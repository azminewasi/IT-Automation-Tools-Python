All the modes are in the limelight now!","[""It's a great game, great racing experience, takes time to master, and lots of fun once you get good, fast cars. The only problem is that getting good cars can be a long process unless you're willing to spend real money, and even then, there's a lot of grinding involved in order to obtain currency and parts that you need to purchase and upgrade new cars. I just wish that they would make it easier to obtain new cars and not make it so difficult to progress in this game. It would be SO much better."", ""This game is amazing, but after a while of not playing it I came back to see a big difference in the ui, and it just makes everything slower, and also the way there's character animations now just kinda make it feel a bit more like a pubg ad at the end of races somehow, I don't really know what it is it used to bring me so much nostalgia till the update :( Still fun to play and I'm sure that a lot of other people prefer the new layout but I personally rhink a classic mode or something would help"", 'Super fun, and I really appreciate them keeping this updated and active despite there being a newer version. Controls are easy to make comfortable, fun and easy to play on both PC and mobile, relatively realistic with stats and physics to my knowledge. An interesting variety of maps and race types, great music. I honestly prefer it to Asphalt 9 because it feels easier to navigate and more user-friendly', ""Excellent game, high frame rate, no play limit, and menus are easy to navigate. I highly recommend this game for casual gamers. Just focus on getting a really fast car, and you will have adrenaline speed fun for hours! I wanted to rate this games 5 stars, but I don't like that alot of the cool cars require tokens to get, which are almost impossible to obtain without making an in-app purchase."", ""Overall, this game is really well designed. The graphics are very realisitic and I love how you made Credits that are just like Coins. Maybe make some different tracks because it's boring just going on the same tracks. Also, can you make an update where you play like a parkour where you have to go over jumps or something. And if you finish top 3 or something you get 500 Credits or maybe a New Car Unlocked. Like I said, I really love this game and I would recommend it."", ""It's a a awesome game with an imaginative twist, actual cars with real upgrades makes it that much more enjoyable. So many tracks and bonus features, you can never get bored. The bonus features make it that much more possible to gain position against the feirce composition. Have Fun and don't be afraid to take out the composition."", ""This is one game I've been playing for a while. Very addictive lol! I would give it a solid five stars however, I can do without the freezes. Also it would be great if the timer for the boost didn't start before the race begins and stop after the race ends. It's kind of a rip off that the timer starts before the race begins and waiting for other players to join i.e multiplayer and continues after the race ended."", ""With all the new improvements and class rework, I would say this game is worth getting. Its fun, action packed, and an overall amazing game. With it being compatible with keyboard, touch, or controller. I'd say this is pretty cross-platform. I will admit it can be very grinding heavy."", 'Between iOS and android ive been Playing Asphalt 8 for years. I would love to give this a 5 star review, but however cannot. My only issue are the Atrocious ads. I would love to pay for something if it were to permanently remove ads. I reached out to customer service through the app and was told that some purchases ""might remove ads temporarily So be sure to Keep checking the shop for desired deals"". However, none ofthe ""deals"" in the shop mention anyting about removing ads. Unplayable as is.', ""I used to think this was a good game, now I'm not so sure. For one, its really bad when the only way to get credits is by racing or spending actual money. And that brings me to my second point. When you actual do spend your money, the game will say transaction failed because of poor connection even though your connection is fine, and yet Google Play will still process your purchase! So now, your out however many dollars you spent to make the purchase, and yet you have nothing to show for it!!"", ""I played this game a year or two after it's release and it was great but now it's changed for the worse. You used to be able to use bikes in normal campaign which they removed and the new menu interface sucks compared to the old one. The adds used to only be after races now everytime I back out of a setting or after upgrading a car it gives me an add which is too excessive. Honestly this was an amazing game when it was first released now it's garbage. This app has not aged well. Unistalled."", 'The graphics are pretty and the controller support is good. Beyond that this game is not worth anyone\'s time unless you plan on spending massive amounts of real money. Like most ""progress as you go"" race games, you start out with your typical slow beginner car and are supposed to eventually tune it and tweak it and eventually buy other faster cars to continue to participate in events both career and multiplayer. Unfortunately the only way you\'re going to be able to do that is to spend a lot of your real cash to upgrade cars or spend many many hours repeating the same courses over and over again until your eyes bleed so you can farm the money you need to buy cars that have even half a chance against the established field of competition. After watching youtube videos on strategy I spent over $60 USD to try to follow the plan to success and my beginning cars are not even halfway to their full potential of upgrades and lightyears behind anyone I get paired with on anything multiplayer. The dollar amounts keep more than doubling to upgrade the cars to the next level and the amount of hours I\'m looking at to even put a dent in the upgrades I ""need"" to keep going is just ridiculous. If I wanted to punch the same buttons over and over again, day after day with no end in sight, I would go get a factory job. Even at minimum wage it would be more rewarding than being able to brag about how fast my pretend car is after wasting real big chunks of my real time to get it. I\'m just the silly one who thinks if a game is about racing fast cars you should be able to install it and race a fast car. I\'m already broke and wish I had a different car in real life. I don\'t need Gameloft\'s help in pretending to be poor in a game too.', ""I love this game, too much maybe. I don't have any problems with it. Some cars are very expensive, but thats expected from a high graphic racing game, especially the best on the appstore (in my opinion.) It'd be nice if there was a way to drive on the levels with no other racers, for practice, like a freestyle mode. Awesome that this game is free!"", ""Its fun, but the difficulty needs re-adjusted. There are so many paths to take it gets confusing. Also, I bought the car pack for $5 and the cars it gave me aren't even good... The D-class starting car is way better than my purchased D-class, and I even tuned the purchased car more. I feel ripped off. It took me umpteen tries to win the second race because the game is unbalanced. Opponents are faster even with tune-ups and can take shortcuts that are easy to miss and just leave you in the dust."", ""It's a cool game and it runs smoothly during races but it takes forever to load the rest of the features like modifications, features, and the downloaded content for the quick races. I have a cheep phone running it, though. I don't even have service and I have to run on free WiFi, so it's may be my problem and not the game. I really like it, the pros outweigh the cons. Thanks for your hard work Gameloft!!!🐿️"", 'Great game, though be prepared to set your device down and wait 30 sec after some races in career mode. Watching the ad is optional, but doing so will at least double the credits earned (usually more like 10x or 15x) It is a little bit of a pay-to-win, if you want to be really good at the events, but thats not the ges fault. Its only because your competing against other players who have already paid money to get extra boosts and stuff. Overall, it is a great game, highly recommend.', ""This game is is good, Very good I like the graphics and the racing. It also has good handling so you can win the race it is kind of hard at the same time because you crash a lot but it is still the best game. Also it could need some upgrades because like sometimes bugs and stuff like that. Also it lags when you go to the next car because there's a lot of cars. But it's a good game!!!😁😁"", ""1 of the best racing games I've played on my phone. Great graphics, control's, spectacular sceneries, fabulous cars to drive fast with and do tricks with. Sometimes there is a little bit of a lag with Multi player load screens, and doing the free videos for items. You guys need to bring back the rest of the car's so I can add them to my collection."", ""Asphalt 8 is arcade racing game. It has various maps, modes, cars, and fun gameplay experience. Vehicles fall in different categories depending on what each car can offer. Each vehicle can be upgraded to improve its performance in a race. If you upgraded your vehicles high enough, you can be matched up with other cars in higher tier. My issue is it's credit system. Everything is expensive and it forces you to purchase credits or tokens with actual money to purchase some virtual car. 6/10"", ""Way too many ads. The cars are cool, the races are fun, but the interrupting ads every 60 to 90 seconds are too much. Update: they changed it again. The pro upgrades are now virtually impossible for those who don't pay to play. I don't spend much time playing any more. Update 5/2020: updates take forever to download, and now the fusion coins make it impossible to upgrade a car. Playing less and less often."", 'This is a perfect balance between pay to win and the complete opposite! The game doesnt force you to need to pay for certain vehicles(although they are expensives). Even then, the game is reliant on your skill and not how fast you go. And unlike a good majority of racing or fighting games, this game in particular ranks your car with others! It is very rare to see unfair advantages due to this. I can only say to make all events accessible with any cars.', 'The game itself is well made with nice graphics, controls and a huge variety of cars. Marketing this game as free to play is nothing more than a blatant lie. I have been playing the game with the same car for about a season and a half because saving up enough in game currency for a new car that is actually viable is not possible. I have also been racing this 1104 ranked car against 1250 ranked cars because the upgrades are expensive. Of course, if you spend LOTS of money all these issues go away', ""The game has great graphics, and the controls on PC are simple to learn. The game doesn't allow you to advance in career pass 10 stars. When you go to commence the race for the Audi R8 Tron the game silent crashes. Also I would say that a great deal of finance is needed to gain more advanced vehicles aside from the occasional festival. The multiplayer mode is good but the rewards are not worth the time investment necessary to obtain them. That aside the game is fun but not worth the money input"", ""New multi-player sucks!! I have only won once out of over 5 dozen attempts. Used to win or place 2nd on numerous occasions. The new format makes it impossible. Used to love playing this game...until they added all of the ads that pop up when trying to start a race or navigate to different screens. Its exhausting now...considering deleting app if the frequency of ads doesn't go back to how it was before. I don't mind an ad here and there, but not everytime I try to select something."", ""It's a great game, but it glitches many times throughout my experience. For starters, I can only upgrade a feature for a car (Eg: speed, braking) once, before it tells me I need to check my internet connection, although it's working fine. I've noticed throughout other features in the game as well, and wish this could be fixed. If there's any way I can help fix this, I'm here to help."", ""This was a very cool game but after the Feb. 12 update ruined it. Now the game takes forever to load. After it finally loads, I might be able to play for a very short bit and then the game CRASHES!! It repeatedly crashes when I try to restart the app and now I can't even get into the game! Tried uninstalling and then reinstalling but that does nothing. Still crashes! Once I got excited because it started to load, but then took a long time to load only to crash after just few minutes of play!"", ""The graphics are great. Starting the game is confusing and lacks information on how to proceed. So much so that I uninstalled the game before completing the setup....I think. It took me to a screen to subscribe but didn't tell me anything except how many other had subscribed. What would I be subscribing to??? Your guess, my guess. Then a screen with a menu but what the heck is what, again no info or not instructions or direction of any kind. I don't have time for guessing games."", ""Awesome game but...I don't know if it's my tablet or the game it's self but it keeps crashing. With it still being a very good game it needs a bit of work, instead of giving decals we should be able to customize the cars to our liking. The music needs to be dated, (I like to listen to good music while playing.) Overall very good game hands down."", ""DON'T DO IT. THE GAME IS DEAD. I can't describe how bad it is now and it isn't one of those things where you can still have fun once you get serious. Earnings are down, every good or decent thing takes stupid amounts real money, cars and event progress was reset, and ever car requires wayyy too much time to grind for. If they reset your progress to make you spend more money once, they can do it again. I have lost all trust in the game and developer. You killed a racing legend. Asphalt 9 is meh."", ""Yikes I miss the old game. The ads aren't that bad in my opinion because I have seen worse but the true problem is that every single car is insanely overpriced. Some cars are double or triple the amount of credits then they were before. Also the career is unrealistic that you have to get every single star to progress in the season and it wasn't like that before. The UI is very nice and the new cars are cool but please just make everything priced the same as before, you'll get more players back."", 'A well rounded racing game. The controls are simple, the races are fun. And for a mobile game, this has some of the best graphics I have seen in a long time. four stars only because of some bugs that cause my car to freeze during a multiplayer race. Which is extrememly annoying as it allows my opponents to pass me.', ""This is probably the best free racing game on the play store. I would even say it's better than most payed racing games. The controls are great with a large selection of styles to pick from, the graphics are stunning for mobile, and it runs really well for how good it looks. Only downside is that progression can be pretty slow at times, replaying the same races constantly to scrape credits together to unlock new races. I would recommend this to anyone with even a slight interest in racing games."", ""Good racing game, fast paced & exciting. The cars are spot on for a game. More than enough to do, events, daily specials, select car races, multiplayer etc. Get to paint the car or do graphics, tuning in 4 areas & a pro mode tuning. Never the less, A few weeks into the game and without spending real money I'd have to say that I'm done with it & will be deleting it. It's a huge game & not worth keeping if your not playing on a regular basis."", 'Cars, good. Play, good. Graphics, good. Sound effects, good. Upgrades were strange/unrealistic (16 tires for a tire upgrade, you only have 4 wheels.) 2 yrs. ago, but I dealt with it, part of getting your money. After the update before this latest, the one introducing fusion coins, I thought ""what are they thinking?"", and now with their latest update: "" now, they are just way too greedy! They are getting ridiculous! It\'s not worth my time anymore.', ""Such a fun game, but it has so many problems. I use manual acceleration, and the touch zones for the buttons are so small and completely unadjustable that its impossible to get through a race without the game thinking you lifted off the throttle. Also, the controls don't show up until the race actually starts, so its impossible to get a perfect launch like you would with auto acceleration. Finally, too many cars require tokens to buy, and a lot of the game is behind a pseudo-paywall."", ""Insanely great game. The controls for laptop are super easy to use, and are positioned so there is no scrambling and wrong button pushing cuz the keys are so close together. The graphics are one of the best on Google Play. There is no shortage of content. My few complaints are some technical issues. Sometimes the multiplayer can't connect, sometimes u can't collect certain prizes, and there is an option after races to double ur rewards by watching an ad, but it never loads. Would recomend."", ""Really great game. Few things I don't like, is that I wish you could convert tokens into credits, and credits into parts, due to how little credits you earn. I also wish that the cars would do barrel rolls, only when possible. Last thing is I wish that the physics are more realistic; meaning if you land on your side/roof, you don't wreck, unless it's at a high falling speed."", ""I have been playing and enjoying this game for many years. I have rarely had any problems with this game running on my Samsung S3 tablet. It runs well even at the highest graphics setting. After yesterday's updates however, the game continuously crashes every time that I make any changes in the settings which I was able to do before.

The graphics, the cars, the different types of races, everything is amazing! The only two things I dislike are: So many cars you have pay real money to get, and that after a race it doesn't show you how many coins you got unless you don't want to retry. I really dislike that last feature, as then you have to go back to main screen and re-enter the race (which takes some time to load.)"", 'The graphics are amazing, and the detail is on point, but what the heck is wrong with the controls?? Every time i steer in a direction, i have no control over the steering. Meaning i cant stop myself from getting into a wreck. Please fix this. Edit: Nevermind, all i had to do was reinstall the app! Keep up the good work, Gameloft!', ""I used to play this game so much. I got a ton of the expensive cars. I had a ton a fun. But years went by and I couldn't get the account on my old tablet to my first phone. No problem. I thought I would just start playing a ton again. The game is much different. Too many ads. Everything I click something it's telling me to not vape and stuff. Overall just annoying"", ""It designed very poorly. The obvious focus was on graphics and as a result The tracks are terribly laid out, the events are not well planned and the overall feel of the game is that the designers didn't care about their project, just the graphics. There are cars where there shouldn't be any, on Italy in particular u can't drift like you're supposed to and even when u do its never clean. China is literally designed to make players wreck. 2 stars both of them are for graphics. But that's all"", ""Altho, this game is gr8, in steering n keeping it steady. Its almost similar to Asphalt 9. The upgrade boxes isn't that easy to get, n boxes go for 10000 coins, or u can win them boxes during some missions or if u get promoted to the next level. 2 things should b change: 1 is spending real cash (instead of game coins) on certain cars to pass a level, n wit the game coins it should b used to purchase upgrade boxes for our cars."", ""It's a cool racing game but it still is necessary to buy stuff to complete. Not all have money to spend and just to play a game. But it does have very good graphics and easy gameplay. If you do not pay them $$$ tgen you will mysteriously wreck. I was in first and all of a sudden I wrecked. I was going straight and not even near a barrier! Come on devs??? How can you be so $$$ hungry??? Until these things are resolved you will not ever get a 5 star review from me."", 'One of the best racing games thus far. A lotta fun with many races and challenges as well as many sports, muscles and exotic road cars to choose, the controls takes a bit of getting use but I like the fact that you can actually drift around the corners and bens if you time it just right, the game play and graphics however is phenomenal, the ads are a bit annoying but you do get double the bonus, rewards and even more money and upgrades and can be even better in the coming updates thanks...👌👍🌚', ""Yes, this IS the racing game you should download! Its compact, offline (online optional), and an adrenaline rush! I've been playing Nitro for years now. Of all the games on my phone and tablets over the years, this game has remained the longest. You can upgrade your car and unlock new ones, race around the world in exotic locations, and grind through exciting races to unlock kit boxes! I even figured out a bug that allows a player to keep doubling their reward money. I got 34,000 for a 1,000rwd"", ""I have had an amazing experience with this game. I love that it is so similar to the Asphalt series, and that the graphics are still so great for the cars. If you love asphalt, but don't have the storage space, this game is definitely for you. One minor issue, though: I feel like the catch mode is a great idea, but the land mines are literally impossible to avoid in a fast car, and I have amazing reflexes. Even with that, this game is still amazing for its small size. 5 stars."", ""Peace!!!! I can't say just how much I'm liking this game, however; I will say this: I am excited about it. This one is awesome when it comes to having a little fun time.... The graphics and background is just fantastic. And may I say the Steering seems to be a whole lot easier. Can't wait to stack the chips, to purchase faster cars.... two thumbs up...."", ""My first Asphalt experience is Asphalt 8. This game was made before that one so the quality is not as good, less graphical fidelity and harder to do barrel rolls. But the foundation of a fun Asphalt game is still here. It controls well and there is a lot of content. But after a while the way you have to grind for wrenches to be able to upgrade your car is where you're gonna feel like you need to spend real money."", 'I would give it a 4 star beacause mostly the gameplay is cool and the fact that you can bump into stuff. The graphics are amazing and you can change the angle of the camera. But because is a lot of the cars cost money and theres not that much cars that dont actually cost real money. At leats make a couple of cars that dont cost money ( not saying its a pay to win game )', ""The game is good but the uprades takes me half a year to fully upgraded it. Coz the kit boxes that you buy is exceeded only for. 1 purchase. And that's how your game irretates me. While facing online I encounter with some upgraded cars and I'm always left coz they're car is just too fast. Having thought of upgrading my car was just a little disappointing for me. Just pls remove purchase limit and if so I can change my mind giving u a five stars."", ""What is happening with this game Gameloft I'm very disappointed with this game's performance. When I play it offline then it's running smoothly but when I play it online then it's starting shut down automatically. Why this is happening fix this bug immediately I'm very dissatisfied. Overall the game is very good. But the developers of the game they have to fix the bug. Thank you."", 'The game is fun and the graphics are amazing but the thing that does not make sense in the game is that in some levels you have to buy car before you can play that level.and in the setting if you want to change the control of the car to steering if you want to turn the car normally goes opposite.If the person that eventually made the game can change it the game will become more useful to people.', ""This is a great game and I diffentley recommend it 👌.It has good gameplay,but please make the graphics a bit better like the graphics in aspalt 8. I used to have aspalt 8 but deleted it beacuse it would force the player to use real money I am not spending R100,00 for some stubid tokens this game also does not do this thing where if you get a new car it well say unlock a whatever level but you can't even drive the car so you can not unlock it so this is a much better game ."", 'The game is great.it has good graphics forits size.but it needs new maps and new levels and you should remove the specific requirements for completing the level like buying some particular car.and you should be able to customize your car and you should also make the upgrades more easy because we can only upgrade a car after having some particular items.', 'This is the best racing game ever.Please add more new cars,new race locations, new racing tracks.Please make the graphics more realistic and more beautiful. Sometimes this game gonna closed. Please fix this problem and make this game super fast and smoothly controlled.', ""There is also some problem involved with the ads. If I click to watch an add to double my rewards, they say I have no internet connection. But when I'm about to start a new race the stupid 20 second long add pops out. What is up with that."", ""The game is very very good and attractive with car's model and it's graphic. But we user need coins on road by which we can collect them. And also give the best background music like in Asphalt 8. So please listen us. Be thanks to you.🏎️🚓🚗🛻🚙🚐"", ""Great game, unmatched driving experience but since I updated the game on the 13th of April, it has refused to start.

That's the reason for my rating it 1 star."", 'This game is awesome i like the game the graphics are excellent but when i was playing the steering is moving in the opposite direction i am facing so much problem by this. I request you to kindly fix it.', 'I will give it a solid 5\\5 because i like the racing car and the lamborghini and the ferari because both cars are fast So im gonna rate it a 5/5stars and this is beter than asphalt 8 but i dont know what is the best asphalt nitro or asphalt 9 because the graphics look like the same And the problem is my phone is a litle lagy but i realy like it so.............yea bye :):):)nice', ""I would love of the developers add new map thet would be epic But there is a slight problem that if u delete it and then download it again ur whole progress is gone and if u sign in again then also it restarts with no progress That's why I give it a four star otherwise a really good game by Gameloft"", 'Its a good game the graphics are good too but the problem is cars are too expensive and there are too many adds and hard to get money and we need more locations and more game events', 'I love ASPHALT NITRO because this game is so fun!!! In all of the games downloded on my gadget the Asphalt Nitro is my most favorite game. I rate this game with 5 Stars! First Star: Because of the Great Graphics. Second Star: Because of my favorite Sports Cars. Third Star: Because of FREE CAR PAINTS. Fourth Star: Because of Good Controlers. Fifth Star: Because of Faster Cars', ""At first it was okay not until it started asking for update and after updating it, it continuously kept on asking for update yet I had just updated it.

Thank you for listening.', 'This is the best car racing game and it is very clean game ever gameloft keep it up I love it. I wish gameloft app can grow into a super big company. The limit is 5 stars but I say 100/100 this is a great game Subscribe to Asphalt on YouTube please', 'This is the best racing game ever but the cars are expensive also graphicals atleast shud be realistic n the game keeps on stoping in my phone and that is y have given three stars', ""The game is tonight but the cars are expensive but I want the cars to be low price so that we can buy the card so that we can use to complete the game the game is so nice if I have money I will send it to the software developers of this game you are coming to start the game is if you are coming to start the game restart a game on another day you must give us daily reward that you can use to add our our money so that we can don't like on this game is because when you can't get anyone."", 'Easy to play.

Although, the community is kinda toxic, it's slightly P2W, and the physics somethimes want to mess up. The maps and graphics are amazing (especially on high quality), but sometimes there are some sections that are hard to get right. The car choices are also good, but some of the cars have terrible stats that prevent them from being able to dominate the tracks. Overall, good game, just at least fix the physics."", ""The game is extremely fun & frustrating at same time. Once you get to a certain point on game you no longer can pass races. Your car simply isn't upgraded enough and or your stuck unable to move to next chapter because you don't have a certain cars blueprint unlocked yet. Basically forced into spending money to advance any further or keep trying your luck opening (Free Ad Packs) which is what I've attempted to do, 9/10 you don't even get the blueprint you need."", 'I love this game so much. The gameplay is so well thought out, controls are flawless, cars are beautiful, currency system is not too easy and not too hard, tracks are so well made and designed, I noticed, and the cinematic replay option has made my days so much more relaxing as I watch the beautiful race go by. I love everything about this game. Ads are not very common and very bearable, literally no reason not to get this game.', ""I had this game on my laptop. It was so much fun. I enjoy this game so much. Recently I've been experiencing a glitch were the game is still running but the screen is black. I've tried unistalling and reinstalling but nothing helped. I have a Samsung galaxy a11. It also glitches out the map when I play races so yea plz fix"", ""This is so unlike the Xbox version. They bombard you with ads even if you choose not to get ad rewards. Almost every 3rd race. 30 seconds or so and you can't even get out of it. If I choose not to claim rewards, they should not force me to watch their ads. Touchdrive is a bit too easy. You can literally just leave it on and poke the icons or drift and place 1st with no skills at all. At least with xbox you can still influence the steering with touchdrive. Can't join clubs across platforms"", ""To start off, the graphics as well as performance is excellent for an app. There is plenty of tips, information and race modes to keep you busy. But, the reason for (3 stars) review is because the app randomly closes when I'm racing. That immediately puts me out of the fun. I've done different options to fix the problem but it looks like Uninstall the game is my last option. I tried One on One support within the app but it locks me in a fixed set of options that are automatic. Sorry but it's 😡"", ""Genuinely great after having played for about 3-4 hours total. Probably the best graphics I've personally seen in a mobile game, hands down. The controls, if you go full manual control, take some getting used to but there's an option to go to a one touch method if desired, which is helpful! The closest thing we've gotten to a Burnout game since Burnout Paradise honestly."", ""Extremely fun game. I personally haven't been annoyed by the ads, and there is a bug when setting the game up that could annoy people. The graphics are insane and the auto drive makes it a nice and chill but fun game. It does make my phone hot and drains my battery but most extreme graphics games do that. For people that are having infinite loading times: When setting up the game, do not link your play store account. It'll cause infinite loading times."", ""This is a genuinely enjoyable game. However, the constant paywalls for everything make it impossible to advance into the next season. Also the blueprint structure is absurd. I have spent real money in this game because I don't mind supporting good phone game development. Even with spending USD, I still can't progress within the game. Certain races only have 1 car as an option. And you need 50 blueprints to unlock that single car for that one race. Crazy!! Not spending 1000 dollars to advance."", ""The game looks good, but quickly gets boring due to the developers being so focused on making in game sales. Forcing players to upgrade before continuing on, making it difficult to upgrade your car due to a bunch of hoopla, etc. I can't knock a person for trying to increase their finances. I just wish that the developers would charge for their products out right, therefore they don't have to interfere with the games progress, by adding unecessary confusion and cheap tricks. Another Uninstall"", ""Been playing for a few years off and on. My biggest gripe with this game is the lack of various level design. They all seem like the same track re-skinned. My second issue is repetitive card packs. I pay for the legend pass each season and the card packs I get are always the same. I don't need about 90% of them since they are for fully maxed out models I already have."", 'This game is one of the best games that can be played on a mobile phone. Would be awsome to see maybe some classic muscle cars or maybe a new version of the game that is dedicated to the classic muscle cars. Visually the best game ever probably. Only subtracted 1 star because of cheaters, and because of how the game starts to get impossible to progress past a certain point without paying money, I suppose this is ok for people who can afford to do so.', ""The game is good, but it takes FOREVER to get at least 1 truly competitive car from every class. I've been playing for 8 months, but I only have competitive cars from 3/5 classes. I still only have 2 class S cars, and only 1 of them is fully upgraded, the Centenario, which is a weak car. 👉 Also, I just watched 5 straight ads to restock my daily event tickets, but I didn't get credit for ANY of those ads. There's also a 15 second ad thats been crashing repeatedly every day for several weeks."", 'It\'s a good game, but everything costs money. Your cars have limited gas and you have to watch tons of adds to skip this, and for events you have limited ""tickets"" which you also have to watch ads for once they run out. It\'s nearly impossible to get a lot of good cars without paying. Super greedy developers', 'WAAAAAY TOO MANY ADS. I understand that the company wants to make money, but this is ridiculous. I race once watch an ad. Race again, watch an ad, watch ads ro refuel. It gets monotonous very quickly. Leveling up your cars is slow as well. Not a very balanced game at all, but spend money and you can get a decent car, otherwise, slog through hours of ads.', ""It's a fun game and Ive been playing it for years but recently it has had a lot of issues with the cars not responding to controls or immediately veering off to one side when you start. At first I thought it was my phone but It has happened on multiple devices and is being reported in forums by other player. Basically unplayable when only 1 out of 3 races work"", 'The Better you get at the game the more it seems to cheat. I thought it was simply getting more difficult at first, but now i see the game doing things that are clearly not possible. In 1 race I had a car right beside me switch its rotation completely in mid air simply to steal firstplace from me! How can an object weighing a couple thousand lbs. defy the laws of physics like that. I know the games allow us to do things that are impossible, but come on...', ""Awesome graphics. Waayyy too many ads. I could have stayed with this game for sometime but will have download because, not only I'm I getting ads, but also my progress has stalled in the second chapter with no conceivable way of making progress outside of spending boatloads of money (after which I'll still get bombarded with non-stop ads). No thank you."", ""I get a couple races before the game crashes and I have to restart usually mid race, so gas lost and tickets if I'm playing one of the daily. Graphics are great. Races are great. But losing a race because the game freezes is terrible. Fix this and I'm all for 5staring it."", ""Update: now 61% career progress, level 12 garage blah blah. This game is off the hook fun. Being an arcade style racing game, gameloft hit this out the park. The graphics and lighting effects are superb. Only thing for new players is get used to which control settings suite you, it will take a min to figure it out. But when you get it down your gonna be watching your replays. 10 star not 5 star game here. 1 thing, make all cars more obtainable, we'll be playing for a decade to collect them all."", 'None other than pure enjoyment! I have this game on mobile, Xbox one, and Nintendo switch. ALL versions great! The ""touch"" control scheme is the most innovative I\'ve come across and makes it far easier to progress through the seasons. When ready for a real workout I can switch back to manual controls and try doing it all myself. For anyone complaining of cash transaction tricks don\'t worry. I\'ve earned much without spending a dime. Be smart and you will earn plenty without spending. Great game!', ""Great at first, but they so focused on making money you quickly stall out unless you spend a lot. I don't mind buying some things in a game but it's ridiculous when you have to constantly keep buying and buying and still unable to get that far cause your cars aren't upgraded enough to continue to the next levels."", 'At first, playing this game has great graphics and a nice starting lineup of vehicles. Not long into the game you realise that the cars drive themselves with little to no input from the player. If you choose to drive the cars manually the game very quickly becomes clunky and complicated. Should create a steering option that allows the player to not get vertigo trying to play this game!', ""***2/82022 UPDATE - thank you for the new filter garage option! However, it's not permanent. It reverts back to default every time you leave the garage so we have to reselect our filters each and every time. Y'all almost nailed it perfectly. Next update maybe?*** Great! More cars that I'll never obtain. Give us a button to hide locked cars. Too much scrolling through stuff I don't have."", 'The game is amazing! I would give 5 stars, but there is one problem, there are no classic cars. I really want to be able to race cars like 1968 Dodge Chargers, or other classic muscle cars like that. but other then that, the game is great and keep up the great work. PS. Please attempt to make a free ride feature.', ""It's a fantastic game all together but the more you advance into your career you can't advance unless you have a certain car and if you don't have enough blueprints to get the car you need to buy it and when you do you need to keep staring up the car with in app purchases. Gameloft I know that you want to make money but you should make it a little easier to upgrade your car."", ""I dont like that you can't buy cars outright with coins anymore but that honestly would been overlooked if you didn't get ride of the motorcycles and powerups. Those were epic new additions that solidified A8 as my all time favorite. This version honestly feels like a down grade. It's rather boring, repetitive, mundane. I'm a big fan of the game series and hope to see better in A10."", 'There is still some room for improvement. A winner takes all rewards mode would be nice. (all the credits usually rewarded to all players given to the #1 driver in that multiplayer race) This type of race would be like ""elimination"" from the previous asphalt games. The multiplayer experience would be even better if players had time to look at the map route selected and pick their best cars giving them a better chance for success. These are my two and only cents I\'ll give you guys, good luck.', ""This game is pretty cool and all, works really smooth, but there's something wrong. when i start a race the car is immediately turning to the left and right and gets stuck the second I take off at 1. I have no control and the touch drive option is not on, I've reinstalled the game and it still doing it. Please fix this."", ""This game is very good. I like it very much but the progression is non-linear, meaning up to a certain point the game becomes extremely hard to progress because you have to get a blueprint for a certain car that isn't always available. This often halts progression quite alot. Another main thing is the game is pay-to-win unfortunately, you progress the game by a lootbox-esk system. A good thing that you don't see from many mobile devs is that they are very generous to fans. :)"", 'Amazing game,I love it!❤️🔥 However, it crashes very often. The bugs include knockdowns out of nowhere, ad bugs, lowering my score in a league every time i exit the app, and sometimes it shows that there are only 3 people before me in a race,but i somehow end in 7th place?? When a major bug occured,they compensated us,the players,and that was great. With a little more maintenance, asphalt 9 will be 🔝', 'Really great game, been playing this game series for as long as I can remember, and I\'m impressed it\'s amazing. My issue though is the way it keeps shutting down usually during ads, saying ""unfortunately the game has stopped"". It can get really annoying lol. I own a 6gb ram phone this shouldn\'t be happening, please look into it. 🙂', ""This is an awesome game. There is many different events to play with tons of cars to try where you can win the blueprints to actually own the car or you can just buy the blueprints in shop option. The graphics are cool and driving expirience is great. Now I could go on and on but I won't, just go play it and experience it for yourself and see how hard it would be to put it down. I recommend this game for sure."", ""I've just had to restart the application 6 times in a row. It keeps getting stuck. Plus the increase in the morning mber of ads is pathetic! Also, in daily events, why are cards of same cars being offered? It's has been 5 years since I've been playing this game and it has been the same. As time passes, this game tends to get boring and monotonous. Uninstalling finally!"", ""It a good game. But I'm giving just 1 stars because for ads. If u want to play the ads for extra rewards or something, acceptable but after every game there are ads. Even if u came back to home screen there are ads. Ok if game is forcing ads then atleast stabilise the game. 70%+ of the times if there is a ad u can just wish your game doesn't crash. That to when my phone is not at all hot and is running at minimum graphic, when my phone can easily handle high graphics game easily with crashing."", ""It started to be full of bugs. Spinning doesn't knock out other players, instead it knock me out. The difference between having Legend pass and normal play is tremendous. Game is acting like a different one without Legend pass. Full of bugs... too bad as I had a beautiful experience until now . I can provide with some video captures showing my car being knocked out on the straight line without having other cars near . All the errors occurs when TouchDrive is ON."", ""I love everything about the game ,but the pop-up ads are so annoying .even when the media volume is set to 0 and do not disturb mode is on and the game volume is set to 0 . The pop-UP AD volume is set to max , imagine playing late at night and suddenly a pop-up ad burst out with max volume . When this probleme is fixed i'll change the rating to 5 stars .ty"", ""The graphics in this game are great. However comparing the gameplay to Asphalt 8 it's just terrible. I used to love playing multiplayer races (which for me is the most important part of game) on Asphalt 8 where skills could lead you to winning the race. Here you win mostly by chance which is frustrating."", ""the game is good...most of the time,the gameplay and the graphics are good and while the game lags occasionally, that's not a big deal. But the ads just ruin it,and if you do not spend money on the offer to remove the ads then an adblocker will only block the video ads and not the banner style ads. If the ads are still in the game by next month,i will give this game one star."", ""Asphalt 9 legends is the one of the best racing games,. It has good graphics, it is also a realistic game, instresting and so enjoyable game. But I have one problem with the game, the problem is that, the game is an online game so it needs internet connection to play it. Whenever my network is poor, I can't play it.

Taking the ball back is a difficult task while all the opponent has to do is get close. Most of the time I tackle, it's a foul while the opponent seems to get away with it every time. The match duration is too short, passing to others is a challenge, through shots are gambles and sprinting isn't advised unless you're willing to risk possession of the ball which more than half the time will end in the others control"", ""Great game. I didn't like it as much in beginning because it takes forever to get your team up to level where you can actually start gaining money and being able to play better. The only thing I'd change is the fact that after you get your team up to a level where you can start winning. All the good players in the auction cost like 30M and up, and I never have that much money unless you buy with actual cash. Maybe add another facility where we make gold and cash at the same time."", ""For those who are saying the graphics are bad, this is a 20mb game so the graphics will not be great. Apart from the graphics the game to be honest is not that bad. The main problem i have with this game is that it's very touch responsive. For example when I'm trying to move the character right, he moves for a bit and then suddenly the player stops and it says that i've not moved him. So it gets really frustrating when I lose games like that but apart from that, the game is descent."", ""I've played it and continue playing it. Finished all the 50 levels earlier and uninstalled it but later when I reinstalled it, one or two things are not right, first, the European tournaments I mean those of countries no longer give players as rewards but only give cash and coins. Secondly, sometimes the game freezes, I mean, if a player is moving with the ball, he won't stop until the ball is out or a foul is committed upon him. Otherwise, it's nice and I'm starting from level one again."", ""It's entertaining, that's for sure. Graphics are good. Gameplay is super immersive. It would be better if an option would be there to allow players to practice taking and saving penalties. A beginner absolutely cannot understand how to control the goalie when saving a pen, or controlling the shooter when taking a pen."", 'A nice game with a few issues. I was in first place in the online leaderboard then suddenly I lost all my points and found myself with 0 points and in 200th position. Secondly, When I train players at 80 or 85 overall I\'m usually told ""the player\'s ability has maxed out"", it\'s frustrating having a 20 year old player maxing out at 80 overall. Also try and make it easier to sign quality players, the player value when buying and selling are quite disproportionate. Many other issues to talk about...', ""aww too bad there are so many flaw to this game even though i honestly think this has the highest potential among all football manager games i've played. i'll try to list them and hope there would be improvements. 1. it continues to close forcefully when i try to play a match. 2. it keeps having problems with cloud saving. 3. now when i open the game it directly goes into a game but i can't play it?? 4. EVERYTHING is expensive. from buying player to facilities. 5. AI is stupid"", 'I used to like Real Football growing up. I played Real Football 2007 I think and RF2009 and the other ones after that. However the game has now officially become poor. It\'s not fullscreen on my Android 9.1 480 x 920 screen. The gain requires data connection to do some things, wants my location to give me ""location specific"" content. What I want is football. That has nothing to do with my location. There there\'s issues with the quick match; only spectators, no players in view and no controls', 'Good graphics but any other thing is zero. 1. Goal keeper cannot catch ball, as a result 98% of the ball that comes direct to the post are a goal. 2. Players accuracy is just 20-30% as such they hardly score or even give correct passes. 3. When you press sprint instead of the player to run with the ball he will push the ball like 4-5mtrs away, which before he catchs up with the ball opponent player will reach and take the ball. 4. 3-4mtrs away opponent players will stretch hand and catch you.', ""When ever I go into the game now, it give me the tutorial again but with my team, and when I kick off, it goes through the other players legs and nothing happens until the first half finishes. Now in the second half, it just shows a black screen for like a solid 30 seconds and then it goes to the game where the timer is stuck on 45 min. and no controls are on the screen and this happens forever. Even when I exit the app and enter again, it still happens. Please fix and i'll change my rating."", ""This game was terrible. The controls were really hard and the game, it's just too much going on. The players loose the ball too easily and the tackles makes no sense at all, sometimes it's clean sometimes it's a foul. And how can the opposition shoots the ball from the halfway line and it ricochet like a bullet towards the goal? Not enjoying the gameplay. One of the worst football games ever."", 'This game is very good for playing when you are bored, and very interesting. But, when I reached division 31, I closed the game. But when I again open it and click to the seasons mode, some graphical flickering occurs and a square of some rewards comes on the side of the screen. When I closes and open the game, it again occurs. When I clicked the square as stated above, it bought back to division 2! (Players were same) All the work to division 31 failed. Please, please fix these problems.', ""The game is good as per it's size. But frequent crashes ruins the fun of game. Everytime when I reach division 3 they relegating me to division 1 and promote to division 2, as I completed division 1. Because of this I cannot accomplish my many missions, and all my efforts are going in vain. Crashes are also occuring while opening lottery packs. When I get a gold player,the game suddenly closes. I wish the developer fix this issues.Then it will be a wonderful experience for those like this game."", ""We're not back in the 90's please!🥱 We expect different gameplay experience, visuals and graphics updates of new talented players from different parts of the on these soccer games...... Learn from Electronic Arts and blow our minds because I be disappointed when I download this malware of app!!!!!!! My data goes into trash for nothing"", ""I'm not happy honestly. I played real football in the year 2012 and I'm disappointed that ten years later the game is almost the same as back then, I had higher hopes for it considering that it was really cool to play on my Nokia X2-01 💔😔 would not recommend unless you are into retro but super side kickers 3 is better which is like a 90's game."", ""It's a good game for beginners but when you progress to higher divisions in the game it becomes unfair for you as the opponent takes the ball from you without tackling. The opponent never commits a foul and your tackle will always result in a yellow or a red card. It is highly unfair for the player as at a point when your team will not work on the ground and the opponent will just take the ball and shoot it for a goal."", ""The gameplay is good, contents like the social tournament and continent cups make the game even more exciting. Regular app crashing has stopped since the last update, good work. Top scorers in the various competitions should be acknowledged and rewarded. I'm enjoying the app! Have anyone noticed that the goalkeeper can rush out of the 18 yard box to pick up balls anywhere without being penalised? 😀😀"", ""The energy points should recover in real time. However I m seeing since yesterday that the energy isn't recovering. I m coming back frequently to check various score updates and play League stages. However the energy that was left the last time I played remained same. Upon clicking on it, the regeneration time period for the energy points arent being visible. Maybe there has been some technical glitch. Plz I want u guys to rectify and act on this as soon as possible"", 'First of all,I love games that created by gameloft! I love this real football game,Graphics are not bad.I m just worried about some control e.g when u want to tarkel a ball is not easy. The gameplay of this game is smooth and lite controls! And also very easy to handle. This game is really for all ages.I m impressed for real football made by Gameloft and also other games like! Pes evolution, fifa ,dream football, I appreciate for football game that I find in play store!!!! Thanks again!!!!!!!!!', ""Never install this game if you get frustrated by small things,because this game will show you how frustrating a game can be. It uses intentional bugs! It happened to me six times,I reached the semi- final of the continental Cup and I like twenty shots on target and none of them went inside.Then suddenly one player shoots from an incredibly long range and it's a goal. The ref is horrible and pls cancel the rebirth thing and let us keep our players bcoz this feature doesn't suit in this game."", ""It's awful although the game's graphics are excellent in my perspective but what is annoying is that after the trial match it directs you to the lottery section in which you have to actually purchase players with real money . I know that lots of you guys including me love the previous version . So its a kind request to the developer to fix this bug of directing to lottery . Instead what u can do is remove purchases from offline mode and shift the purchases to tournaments . Hope u would agree :)"", ""Inaccurate controls. For e.g Player always kicks the ball in oblivion after a sliding tackle. A biased referee and commentators. I've got 5 red cars in one game against a team no-one is supposed to win. In another instance, the ball just disappeared from the goalkeepers hand miraculously appearing with the computers forward near my goal without any of my players."", ""The pictures in the game show great pictures but when you start a match the visuals are not all that good and the most annoying thing is that almost every time you try to take the ball from your oponents,the referee gives you a foul. So at the end of the game you will probably end up with three red cards and two yellow cards.But the game is quite nice anyway. (This is Nana Akua's son and not her).I want gameloft to fix this problem."", ""The game doesn't even load properly. I can't change the settings to be able to have it centered and when it gets to the field, only the shadows of the players are visible! I've restarted it multiple times and same nonsense Everytime. Don't waste your time with this!"", 'Although the game is way more enjoyable than expected , the game has one big issue it forces to buy advanced pack and when want to exit , it says ""You can\'t go back in this stage "" please fix the issue. Otherwise the game is the best soccer game ever played 🤩🙏🏻*WAITING FOR YOUR REPLY*', ""Well I gave it a 3 star before but it's definitely reducing. The compulsory update icon has gone but now I find myself not able to receive daily rewards and achievements, also In world arena when you keep attacking, the energy costs increases from 3-5-10-15 then 20 and restarts every 1:00 at my time zone but for 2 days it has been frozen. Also the fact that the game tries to make you restart when you are making good progress is annoying. It has terminated my progress 6 times. You better Fix it"", ""Edit: 28-06-19 It's second time crashed. I've reached 17 level but now it's back to level 1. Good bye Gameloft, Had enough. 2-06-19 I have reached level 45 and oneday the game crashed in loading. And everythings gone. It forced me to play from level 1 again. I have tried to focus on game after that, but i have lost my interest. And now almost 3 years later i am downloading it again. If anything happen like that again, i won't play EA games ever."", ""Great offline soccer game. But still needs some work. The problem is it's not a fair game, you hadly get to play free kicks or penals, And your opponents never get red or yellow card, but you get it all the time. But apart from that its a great offline soccer game. Also needs more moves."", ""Probably the worst game I have ever played in my life. Response is so slow. The graphics are as if I'm on 1 fps. The lag is unreal. And when im dribbling, it's like he's doing passes because he dribbles it so powerfully. 1 star. Uninstalled and never installing it again."", ""Great app but it sucks when progress is lost all of a sudden after a hard work of creating a good squad then it decides to go to orientations and introduce you to your own team which won't even play until you uninstall the app, reinstall then begin creating a new squad,( i.e a few minutes ago i was number one on leader board but now my new squad doesn't even qualify until at a certain level). Hope you work on that cause it's frustrating when i love the game but can't proceed.5* it would've been."", ""Played for 4 years, I uninstalled the game. The only good side is, you can play it offline. Everything else is bad: Poor game backup, and it keeps resetting the game. No major upgrades on players Poor game support service. Bottom line: do not download/ play. If you really want to, then don't purchase anything or connect with your account."", ""Include top scorers rank such that a player is awarded a golden boot at the end of each season or/and tournament. otherwise this game made it hard for me to play other games on my phone. If I'm not on browsing the Internet, I'm playing this game. fix the bug of the ball disappearing from the field only to find a short from no where."", ""It forces to buy advance pack. And that's horrible, I played it before, that time it was free of cost. Otherwise the game is good. Plz solve this problem. I want to play the game again. WAITING FOR YOUR REPLY!!!!!"", 'This game could be the best, but it has 3. permanent useless issues 1. Freezes your account if you progress well 2. Resets the game to zero most of the time 3. Controls your game instead of allowing you manage it. Solution to all problems is when you create a permanent account. Like how other apps do.', ""The game has always been one of my favourite games, yet lately there has been some glitches in the game. Maybe a bug causing the game to freeze, I'm not sure but it makes the whole gaming experience terrible."", 'This game is terrible and amazing that is why i gave it 2 stars. The thing is that opponents can easily take the Ball from me,they never tackle, only make me trip and sometimes fall me down. But when i tackle ,it always a foul and ends up in a foul ,then a card who guys should really improve this game then I can rate it 5 stars.', ""This was a very fun game but now there is a glitch where I can't play the season mode when ever I try to it glitches out I got very far and now it's useless.

Even drag-and-drop in menus is buggy! Yet there are tons of ads and opponents become much stronger than you very quickly forcing to buy paid boosters to have a chance to progress.', ""Very annoying because the players are automatically faster than you and they just score from random players Everytime you receive a red or yellow card but not them. Training is ok but you can't play training mode pls add a training mode.and last of all the players are just annoying when they pass and they easily dispossess you it is not fair"", 'This game is the worst game ever because like when I play this game, the game experiences glitches in seasons mode and also in the place where you can play against your friends.

But I gave it a 2 because the lag time is ridiculous. So much so that it makes targeting almost impossible. Everything has to be downloaded on to your phone and takes up over 2GB. I'm sorry but 2GB is far too big no matter how much I like the game to be putting on my devices"", ""Fun, simple, addicting, and straight to the point... just the way I like my shooters. My only problem with it is that I keep getting disconnected from the game at least once after every mission I do, but it reconnects fast enough, so it's really no big deal. One quick suggestion for the devs though- This is just my opinion, but I do think cutting down the amount of gold required for certain upgrades, like when upgrading base guards, by maybe half would be much more reasonable. just a thought"", ""Makes you upgrade all the time forcing me to quit and start a new game! November 2019 What ever they were doing on updates they fixed it . I can put up with glitches and freezes once in a while, this is a very sophisticated software game. I don't know how they keep something so detailed working. Super game! 3/16/20 They have corrected whatever was causing the problem. As massive as this program is it runs pretty darn well ! Congratulations on stellar game"", ""very great gameplay and graphics, and the action of explosions etc. It feels like you're playing call of duty or battle field. But other than that I find the controls of where you aim is terrible and because of that I can't really get any headshots and not enough time to shoot like want. but is still one of the best fun sniper games that I've played."", ""The game has real potential, however there seems to be some form of memory leak. The game runs fine for a while and then chokes up as something binds up and starts eating more and more Ram. That said, it hasn't stopped me from playing anyway so the core mechanics behind the game seem sound, we just need the devs to fix the engine."", ""I really like this game... Do you like games where you get to shoot in the first person with a lot of action and really good Graphics then this is a great game for you and can be very addictive... It has Lots of different scenarios... Very fun to play... You get caught up in it and lose track of time because of all the different scenarios like base raids and campaigns or you can pick a weapon and just run sorties with your weapon... I was surprised at how good a game it actually turned out to be because I look for Sniper and first person shooter games and it's hard to find really good ones anymore..."", ""The games one of the better sniper games out there and it really has potential to be one of the top 3. But the latest update screwed that up. Now tour lucky if you can get connected and if you do chances you won't be for long. They say it could be on their end don't delete their game if you don't want to lose progress. I'd rather lose a game that doesn't work than waste over 1 1/2 gigs to hold onto progress. I'm going to give them a little time to fix it. Then bye bye"", ""This is a great game, I love it. There's a recent issue I'm having with this game though. It keeps reconnecting me whether I'm on Wi-Fi or 5G cellular signal. Very frustrating. I'll try it a few more times before I get very frustrated and uninstall this game... This was actually a fun game, with lots to do. Also, what's with the pop-ups at the most random and inconvenient times? 😤"", 'A game with great graphics. Lots of different missions with lots of different weapons. I enjoy the Homebase aspect of it is well. What this game absolutely has to have to make it a five-star is the ability to change where the controls are. I would much rather aim with my write thumb and have the trigger and scope controlled by my left. Similar games such as Sniper Strike have this ability and it makes them much more enjoyable to play.', ""Used to love this game but it seems that with every update something screws up. Game disconnects all the time, game restarts all the time, a lot of times u don't get credit when finished playing a battle in pvp. The latest update caused the game to be unplayable with the starting screen locked up in an endless loop. What a shame. Oh well, time to find a better game."", ""PLEASE HELP??? Four days now, after the update, I can't play this. The screen still has a black line at the top, making the playable screen smaller, making it impossible to do things. I've tried the update, and I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it's still like that. The event ends in just over a day and I'm on the last part, if this continues I'll lose the weapon."", ""I would have liked to give this game 5 stars, because I absolutely love Sniper Games, but most of the time I can't get the app to work or if it does work it sends me back to my homescreen either in the middle of a mission or from the mission selection screen. If you fix this problem I will definitely continue to play this. For now though I'm uninstalling the app."", ""It was fun and addicting but what good does all my money do if I cannot upgrade my weapon with it? I need gold bars and rubies. Graphics are good but you get one star for trying to force me to BUY stuff in order to advance. That is absolute garbage. I'll change my rating if that ever changes which I doubt. Uninstalling after all this time and getting this far but hitting a wall that can only be brought down by paying for it."", ""I love it here. I've been playing literally all day. I just got off of practice and it was the first thing on my mind other than food😭😭 The ads are optional for energy cash and rubies so that's cool and the graphics are good. I'm not really a gamer, but this might change things. Might have to be a try hard😫"", ""This game is the most frustrating of all. Brilliant graphics, fun game to play, interesting, challenging and a favorite of mine WHEN IT'S WORKING!! Would easily rate it 5☆ if it was not down so many times a week. Everything working at once, consistently, is an easy 5☆ but that never happens. Worth a download but expect frustrations in the future."", 'It can be annoying when downloading due to its multiple crash, but trust me it is.

But after some levels it becomes stereotype.', ""I downloaded this game for fun the firstfew days, it was fun. About 4 cities into the game...haven't been able to get, or find necessary equipment to obtain new assault rifle. So, I kept playing and joined the events to get weapons, It never happened . Pvp battles are insane, they pit you against other player's you can't do any damage too, example...my guy was 32000 power, the player's they wanted me to fight, were 30 to 50 times more powerful. It's a scam game, unless you pay, you won't win."", 'This game makes me more fascinating about my specific career which is becoming an army in the future so i learn about some of the skills even if it is just a game danx for dis game', ""At first it was ok, then it gets to levels I had to buy gold or steal from another player. I don't have money to throw away on nothing 🙃, so I am done with this and find another happy with the from the videos they make, especially since I have to watch twice most of the time to get one. I gave it another try but giving PVP in which my weapons aren't powerful enough, that F'ed-up, I have to upgrade base to do it.

Also with the events, like seriously, I have to upgrade my weapon, but I have to redo the first mission that I've completed to get the parts for it? I never finish it. It sucks. Everything else is AWESOME I wasn't kidding when I said I loved it, it wouldn't be a challenge if things were easily acquired but you guys can atleast work on not making it so darn hard. I'm sure if you focused more on fixing the glitches and listening to your reviewer's and doing something about it, you'd get 5 stars all the way"", ""- Pay to play. Too many things in the game cost real money. - Very little tutorial. Almost all of the items you collect you don't know what they are or for. I lose thousands of gold because there's a limit to vault. - Best weapon keeps unequipping its self. - I always accidentally tap the items that you have to buy with real money — radar, armor piercing bullets, slow motion.

The problems come with the multiplayer. It has a tiny bit of lag but that's fine. However, a problem that isn't fine is it's absolutely pay to win in the multiplayer. When you're a fresh player you can dump your entire magazine into another player's head point-blank while they stand completely still before they just turn and one tap you, of course you only did twenty percent of damage out of a hundred percent HP against their OP armor."", 'I picked the game up as something to do before bed. After the cost few levels I started to enjoy the game play and was getting the hang of game play. Now the game has introduced Shadowmissions, but it freezes with no way to continue. The AI is telling me to click the icon for the mission, and I can see it behind her, but there is no ""press to continue"" in the dialogs box, and it won\'t let me click anywhere. So now the game is not allowing me to play.', ""i love the game in every way possible except for when i am supposed to be hiding behind something and i can still be shot. the game would be a lot more interesting and challenging if we could be in each others face shooting, but able to duck in and out of a bullets way. UPDATE:I am experiencing freeze ups for some reason, I have unlimited data so I don't believe it's on my end, please help because this is a GREAT game. I've been playing for YEARS."", ""Super laggy and no options to change server. No way to change button layout. People in multi-player can turn on aim assist and Auto fire which removes all skill so why bother. Can't say anything about campaign but as a multi-player shooter it's insane that they don't have the aforementioned features. Don't play multi-player unless you are super casual and have good internet."", ""EDIT: nothing has changed, multiplayer is impossible to win unless you pay to max your stats. It's broken. I used to play this game a few years ago, and I loved it due to it not having a lot of ads or mobile game gimmicks, but good grief they have added so many now. Also, the multi-player matchmaking is completely broken. I haven't played a match recently that is a fair fight, I might last 10 seconds before getting one-shotted by someone who is at a way higher level than me. It's no fun at all."", ""I really like this game! Unlike what others say, i think the graphics are pretty good, and i only have two issus and one suggestion; for some reason it wont update my user name at all, and sometimes the controls get stuck in a position making me continuosly walk in that direction. As for the suggestion, It would be great if you could increse the max energy to say maybe 20-30, I've found that 10 dosn't last long at all and you can't really get anywhere with it. But other than that, it's awesome!"", ""The campaign levels take too long to load. The gameplay for the campaign is okay, though. I won't even bother with multiplayer matches, due to how the equipment functions. With the equipment being reliant on numbers it creates a huge gap between new and veteran players. So unless you go through the campaign getting better equipment that way don't bother going through multilayer."", ""Game won't work without location permission? Constantly crashes and has way too many unskippable ads even when in the menu screens...that's ridiculous. Also no fire control so theres no real interaction beyond running around and looking at the target... I remember the previous game in this series being better all around. Not worth the storage space."", ""The pvp is a little weird on this game. The PVE was fantastic I like the customize controller option a lot. The graphics, music, and story with the characters were truly 😎 awesome. Thanks for a fantastic game. I've played many games and 💯 your pvp needs a little work. It was a weird experience for a new player on your particular game."", ""Playing from a tablet I found it very difficult to maneuver my person sliding my finger on the screen. It would probably be easier to play from a PS4 or a computer I don't have that option unfortunately. I attempted to use the compass I couldn't even get past the tutorial. If I could get past back I would probably love the game. The graphics were absolutely awesome! But I am an older woman loves war games but this was just a little too frustrating for me. I am sure the younger Generations will love this game. Good luck everyone!"", ""Okay so! I'll preface this by saying this is hands down my favorite mobile game. I love the gameplay, I love the story, I love the multiplayer. But I would like a little more character customization beyond color schemes. Also, if you play on manual (a few of the guns I've unlocked need manual fire for them to work properly) it is difficult to aim to the right. There are a few extra ads than other games but there's not as much pay to win in this one so I don't mind that. All and all, great game."", 'Pathetically easy. 1 2 and 3 had challenge. Why no voice acting, seems really lazy to only use text boxes. But I will say the graphics look really good and I like the redesigned nova suits. I miss being able to shoot on my own. Auto shoot is what makes this too easy. Defiantly a downgrade from 3, which is my favorite one and a game I enjoy quite a bit. Can i just ask why it was removed and replaced with this?', 'The game is really well made and it has a great offline campaign. There are also various events to participate in so you can win new weapons. However the reason I gave this 4 stars is because the ""watch an ad to revive"" and other things like that do not work. Also, sometimes the multiplayer can have a weird glitch and all the characters are standing in place and you cannot attack them which basically ruins the whole match. Other than that it is an amazing game and very well made.', ""This game is a fantastic idea of relative ease to play. Varying weaponry/equipment allows for options in basic game play, but also leads to a pay to win scenario in its multiplayer formats due to upgrade costs. There doesnt seem to be a matching system guide, so you could end up against me when you're a beginner- and I'm not that good. That said, my other chief complaint is connectivity. If you get dc'd you lose all rewards and this is irritating during events. and no, it's not my connection."", ""I played this game a year ago. It was amazing! But I had to delete it because I didn't have enough space. Anyway, I came back and my original profile was gone! I could'nt get it back! And then I played multiplayer and ALL THE PLAYERS WERE INSANE! I could not kill anybody! They had so much better equipment and I didn't stand a chance! Y'all need to put skill based matchmaking in the game, and make getting cards easier. Because of this I often get stuck in the campaign."", ""Game is good. Fun, although repetitive. The only negative mark I have to say about the game, is that you should not have to use energy to play through the campaign. I am more of a Story Mode player, so that kind of sucks for me, to have to wait for my energy to refill. I don't really play multiplayer mode. Good graphics, good game play and controls are almost flawless for a touch screen game."", ""Game is fine. Cool to pass time with. Controls work well and gameplay is great. Decently easy to progress without spending money. Only real drawback so far is lack of expansion. There's only five or so multiplayer environments, and they are getting old. There's many different scenes in the storyline, so I'm not sure why there hasn't been expansion in this area."", ""NEEDS A BETTER MATCH MAKING SYSTEM FOR MULTIPLAYER. i really like this game, it's fun, engaging and has a decent level of difficulty. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is the multiplayer match making. it's very frustrating to be put into a match where everyone has way better equipment, so much so that they can one-shot you, and you can't deal any damage to them."", ""This game looks good but that's about it. First of all the multiplayer mode is impossible. When I shoot other people I barely do any damage. Also its absolutely ridiculous how everyone can one shot me. The campaign is ok but it's missing something. Idk why but it always feels like the ai person was talking too fast. Also the tutorial doesn't let you do anything else besides click the start button. One time I got some rare items and I couldn't equip them because I was still in the tutorial."", ""It's a neat game. I was looking for something like this, but the pay to play is a bit much and the videos for upgrades don't work anymore. Quickly become underpowered and after a few tries you have to wait 20 minutes or pay - and that includes past levels. Controls are so-so, grenade is too close so you end up accidentally lobbing them. Switching weapons often spins you around and you take fire while trying to regain. Available control settings don't allow for modifying any of this."", 'The loading times for campaign levels can sometimes be up to 3 minutes. Multiplayer has very little balancing, where one person can one shot with a pistol while it takes another around 4 missiles to take down another player. Aiming is terrible, I would like to have an optional button to allow you to choose when to fire. Poor story, obvious rip off of halo. Would not recommend.', ""This game is amazing. well built, stunning graphics. unfourtunatly, there is a lot to be desired for. the multiplayer mode has no level matching system, so players with lower rating equipment are pair with veterans constantly. also, if your wifi flucuates too much, it will simple kick you. it's very difficult to build your equipment up because one, the gold cost is expensive even after you get the cards, and you get little from campaign. I have more to say, but out of space."", 'I really liked this game a lot but I really have only one problem that the multiplayer sucks. Whenever I am playing the multiplayer mode, it always pairs me up with the really pro- players with super upgraded weapons and it becomes impossible to defeat them. Another problem I would like to bring to your attention that it crashes a lot.Like..A LOT. So...please fix these two things.', 'A year ago I would have given a five star rating and emaciate response. Altho this is still an awesome game with over the top grafics and easy game play. I appears as if the creators have abandoned the game. Many of the options are no longer working. Some of the weapons are near impossible to obtain because the items needed to obtain them are not available. More adds for pay to play are showing up, and the server is crashing more often. ... I still love this game and will continue to play.', ""Single player game play is alright. Graphics are alright. Multiplayer is complete garbage. It's heavily based on gear and if you're new, you just get demolished constantly. There's not even guards against spawn kills, so the opponent just sits on your spawn point with superior weapons and murders you over and over. It's not fun, just a complete and utter waste of time. I've played this game years ago and redownloaded recently to try again. Still a complete disappointment and waste of time."", ""I have already funneled a good bit of $$ into this game. I love the gameplay, weapons, and customization options. Keep creating new weapons and skins. I believe max cap on the weapon and/or core lvl's should be increased. The biggest issue I have is the horrific lag. #1 priority is creating as smooth a gameplay as possible. I get kicked out of the game randomly and most the time it's in an event match which is crucial. No energy or points are restored towards my event goal. Extremely frustrating!"", 'Your controls and options need work, if you really wanna get noticed for this game, you should allow the ability to choose to use a controller or game pad, and your options should allow button mapping for people like south paws, and take out the energy need for missions. Other than that content is good, but fix the problems and I may play it more.', 'This game is actually really fun...that is when you get to play it. I have to fight through multiple crashes, and force close situations to start each mission. The difficulty does ramp up exceptionally fast with no free alternative weapons to help you progress through the chapters. If these issues were fixed it would be 5 star.', 'nice game.. but mine recently started experiencing a glitch where the ""movement"" and ""firing"" controls disappear off the screen in the middle of the game and im unable to control the character.. very annoying. would appreciate more in game options for gaining currency without having to spend a lot of money.. and more parameters for upgrading suit cores (like speed)', ""I like the game a lot but, I'm one of those people that loves story modes but what I dislike is the energy system. Not being able to play a campaign mission whenever I want or endlessly is just depressing. I like gameloft games a lot but there are two things I have really hated about their games; the energy system and the bad graphics. So what I'm asking is if you could please add more campaign missions with good cinematics. Maybe in a later update as side missions.Pleasetakeoffthepaytowinstuff."", ""Multiplayer is unbalanced and you constantly respawn in front of people. You either have to play constantly to level up your guns or you have to pay to do it. Which isn't really a problem for the singleplayer game because you don't need the highest level gun to get through it. However in multiplayer you have people with a level 1 gun going up against people with a level 10 of the same gun and getting completely annihilated. Also, add in the ability to jump."", ""Good game but only gets 2 stars as there are ONLY 4 multiplayer maps, and players are constantly matched with opponents TWICE their level. My armor is ranked at 240, and I just got matched with some at 450. COME ON!!! Plus it's a little pricey to upgrade. Still, I've spent at least $25 because the game is fun, but honestly, I just want a refund at this point. It's no fun playing against someone who can kill you with 2 shots, yet it takes me 18 to get them to half health. I'm disappointed."", ""This game almost perfectly captured the feel of older arcade style shooting games. The campaign mastered the story telling and plainly set out the goals. The only problems with the campaign is the way you hold the gun (the weird transition of holding to running), The waves of enemies magicly flashing into the room you're in, and the lower quality AI of the enemies. Multiplayer more is what I have the most problems with. It is crazily unbalenced and you are constantly being one shotted."", ""I've been playing the Nova series since the very first game came out. Since the second and third and now with the fourth instalment. Now I love the first three because the concept was very clear. The gameplay was very simple to understand and characters with the story made since. So when this new installment came out I was very happy at first, but after playing the game for a few days I feel like I've lost the joy I felt when I played the first three games. Honesty its not as good as the other's were. I don't know why but its just very different, but not a terrible game. I'm still giving it a chance only because I really do love the first three games. Specially the third one freedom edition was my favorite. To end this on a good note I will continue playing the game just because I see that it does have potential and i do think Gameloft is a good company and that they are still making updates when they can so there's still hope for this game. I wish that I story could be almost like the third but with different stuff to make you as the player feel more connected to the world your in. I give it a 4 out of 10 because its just not up to par with the other's titles before it."", 'It started off as a really cool game and I really really wanted to play it. I was only able to play the first tutorial mission. But once I was done, I was asked to upgrade my new shotgun. However I didnt have enough materials for it so it told me to go to the shop and purchase the crates. Well I claimed my free box and received 50/60 of the shotgun. Well I clicked back to see what else I can do and the screen turned black. I restard the process but everytime I click back, screen turns black.', ""I joined a match and kept getting one shotted by everyone in the match. I figured that was how the game was. I went in for a kill and found out that wasn't the case. I dropped two clips into another play. Over 60 shots. And their health bar didn't move at all. I figured it was a glitch, but it happened two other times after this in other matches. Its hard to enjoy a game thats one sided like that. There are other better games to play."", ""Being an original N.O.V.A. 1 and 2 and 3 fan, this game is amazing in its own way. Though it drifts off from the story aspect, but that's substituted with the clever additions and modes added that'll help you improve your character, his stats and your prep for war and combat and enemies stronger than you. This game is a great time killer for it's grind as hell, though I'd recommend adding more cutscenes and voice lines/dialogue to fit the original more, along with some of it's puzzles."", ""It was kind of ehh... the melee attack was very scuffed and the controls aren't that smooth. The multiplayer could definitely improved though. Instead of people using their own guns, have several different preorganized classes so everyone has a level playing field but still can play using their own playstyle. The game's still pretty fun, but there are improvements that can definitely be made."", ""It's a shamrful remake of the first NOVA game. It removes all voice acting from cutscenes, so characters now seem empty. Graphics are almost somehow worse than the previous NOVA game (NOVA 3). It now has pay to win elements, integrated in the campaign as well! There is a certain point in the campaign where the secretly doesn't allow your shield to recharge untill you kill all th enemies in the area. This forces you to buy extra armor, etc. to progress. Also, to play even campaign missions, you need to use energy, of which you have little. You can wait long periods of time for it to recharge or you can pay. If you want to see NOVA ruined, and you want to waste your time and money to play campaign and multiplayer, then this game is for you. But I would highly recommend getting the original NOVA on PSP or PSVita. It has worse controls but no invasive microtransactions. Don't get this game. Please encourage Gameloft to try better things. This game should be something their company can learn from. Have a nice day! : )"", 'I love this game. It has so much potential to become the best and most played app on the playstore. Add more levels to the original mode, add more weapons, new characters, better storyline, enhanced graphics to make the game more realistic. I know tgese may be hard things to accomplish but i just love this game to the core and i want to see it surpass all the other games.

Not for nothing, I remember being able to stockpile the old crates from events just to be able to buy them after the event is done. The ads, I don't mind at all. I do however give a damn about all the crashing. It seems like I do one mission and the game crashes. It's consistent. And highly irritating Also the main thing stopping me from putting money into the game. Would recommend highly, if it didn't always crash."", 'Amazing, but I wish that there were more people on the road and more cars. This game rocks still, and I would recommend to a friend. Only thing is, could you make police capture more evadable? Like 1 to 3 stars is easily avoidable, but 4 and 5 are close to impossible to escape in a normal car. Thanks for the experience though. Keep it up. (Update) is the game not offline anymore?? I usually play offline...', ""I really love this game from how much details are in here, it's phenomenal how you can do this. But I also have some game suggestions so you could get me downloads. I was thinking about cars randomly generated locked so it would take a little extra time to get into them and then could you add whenever the cars is locked the character will either break it or pick lock it. Thank you so much for taking your time to read this."", ""I only have one small problem. This one vaping real cost ad where you shoot the metals is just stupid, the only reason I say it's stupid is because you cannot exit the ad. Like literally everytime I try and quit or exit the ad it will not let me, it's like the button is not there so I have to exit the entire app just to exit the ad, please fix it. And there should be a feature for all emergency service vehicles that you can turn the siren off and on."", ""Returning player here. Got all of my progress back which is great. Game is really nice and fun especially just to pass time. Game did come out in 2013 so I will cut it some slack on the graphics and the story and open world design is great considering it's a mobile game. Complaints, I recommend having a decent sized GB storage or the game will lag and basically become unplayable, wayyy to much emphasis on buying certain items and seems to be on the verge of pay-2-win."", ""I've been playing this game ever since back in 2016 and honestly I still love everything about it, however I didn't saw much improvement on the graphics. What I meant is Level Of Detail (LOD) / Textures and Draw distance. Making these changes would give it a awesome vivid environment. Not to forget addin more people(Citizens) with more dialogue. And if it's possible, could you devs bring back the old pause menu theme, It's more chill and badass. Plz take this In♥️"", 'I like the game, great story so far and great controls.The gameplay is amazing. While playing u know the ads are kinda annoying but I can still play. A key problem that I have is the enemies takes so many bullets. It took me 3 clips to kill one person 3!!(I had some kinda alien weapon). But so far so good.', ""Downloaded this app again because it's been a long time since I last played it, but I've run into an issue - I can't walk. At least, I can't while I have bluetooth headphones active. If my headphones are connected, the game thinks I'm using a controller and wont let me do anything. I can't find any setting that allows me to change the controls so I can switch it to on screen controls instead of a controller, so I'm stuck with either not hearing the game, or just not playing it."", 'I like this game. Actually a lot and want to play it more... but there are literally 2 times more ads you have to watch then play time. You press a button, an ad. Can we maybe use a hair less ads or have a pay option to remove these ads. Also there are a few bugs. I can not get past ""no deal"" because once I take cover, I can not do anything else.', ""Hi. So I've been facing a major bug in the Greek phalanx mayhem mission. I play with high graphics but people just don’t spawn between the 2 minutes timer. Tried multiple times everytime i could kill about 20 to 25 people. you just can't find more than that. Moreover when the time ends the mission continues to run without the timer and then there are enough people to find but then the kill doesn’t count but the mission is running. I have to abort the mission to stop it. just been Stuck in it."", ""I've always loved this game and I always come back to it. Love that I'm able to save my profile. However, Some changing of the map would be great and the music is super annoying now. It's been the same for years! It be amazing to add some things like snow, snowmobile, motorized bicycle and maybe a skateboard or scooter. Maybe change the map... let us choose a map to load."", ""Hands down one of the best 3rd person Mobile games I've ever played. Graphics are great, missions are fun, controls at first are weird but easy to get used to. It's not pay to win- if you want something you have to grind for it just like in other games but there is also a VIP which gives you perks. The game is constantly updated so you never run out of content. There are some minor issues but they can be looked over, the game can be laggy, character can't walk over sidewalks which gets annoying."", ""Decent game, the graphics aren't that great, could definitely be better, controls are the best thing in the game as of when I'm typing this, just need more options for the boats/planes. I haven't done any missions yet, so I can't judge you there. The game takes hours to download updates/the game itself, figure out how to fix that. The game should have more customization options for vehicles other than the body color, like spoilers, tires, rims, engines, etc., and customization options for shoes."", ""Not sure what happened, the game was decent when I played it over a year ago, now it's just...bad. it takes energy bars to play normal missions when I used to be able to play it all the time with no limit, the whole thing basically pushes you to make in game purchases, there's no originality when it comes to new items. The whole thing just feels like a mess."", ""Controls are clumsy. Buttons sometimes stick. Usually camera isn't pointing in the right direction and centering it doesn't work very well. Feels kinda censored, but it is in Google play store so they cant go too crazy. Best mode of the game is the zombie mode but they almost never have that mode open for play. Should be open at all times... would improve a big improvement... Other than that. Great game"", 'Great game very meticulous only problem I have is the background Graphics are a little Bland if you could give a little more detail to background objects as well as objects in general. But the one thing I want most in this game is a first-person view option for both the car and the character. If you could do these things in your next update I would give you. Cars that would be awesome.', ""There is a lot of ads but overall good game. Sometimes I have trouble getting to vehicles but that's cool. Also I wish they would give the weapon you would need defeat the level especially when you have to shoot people. It makes it even more difficult to beat the level especially when I have change screen in order to buy bullets or change weapons."", ""The game has a good concept but the graphics can never keep up. It's especially hard to drive when you can't dodge cars because you don't see them until you hit them. Also it seems like the police levels in Story mode are a lot harder than in normal mode. Everything is! In story mode, my cars are constantly getting flipped over by nothing, the other cars are always in the way (even the smallest motorcycle can push my whole car to the other side of the street). There should be checkpoints!!!"", ""It is a bit glitchy here and there even with low quality but I really like the game. You should also make the chop shop more interactable like being able to decrease the time for doing something for the owner of the shop. Something that bothers me is saving your progress. I had 72% completion, missing 6 collectibles, and getting event rewards that I don't see again. I got a new phone, installed the game and saw that I had 0% completion even though I used my Google play account. Please fix this."", ""WOW! This game is top tier right here, there's a stupid bug stopping me from playing this cool awesome game. At the beginning of the game ( the tutorial) the movement stick is gone. I can't move and I'm stuck on the tutorial. I can't progress though the tutorial without a joystick. Please fix this bug and I'll give you five stars. This game is still too cool to uninstall. I'll hold on to this game until you guys fix this bug. See ya!"", ""It's a really fun and decently well made game, but please fix the car spawns and mechanics. I've had cars spawn at intersections causing me to crash into them, and I've had cars suddenly turn for no reason on a straight road with no where to turn into on that side. It's very frustrating during missions when I'm in a slower vehicle trying to escape the police."", 'This game is amazing; the weaponry is good, the driving mechanics are smooth, the character movement and animation is mindblowing, and all on mobile! Heck, even better thing is that it is offline! Love it sooo much. This is breathtaking work compared to all the quick cash FPS out there. Now, the thing that I hate is that you have to pay money EVERY time you die. :/ And the fact that it is so much sucks. I close the app and reopen it every time I die. Otherwise, keep up the great work!', ""One of the best mobile game apps I've ever played. Great graphics, lots of equipment to purchase, play to win is possible but its a little faster if you can buy a few little things. There's like 3 story lines running at once to choose from. Amazing game play. From kidnapping to Aliens and Jet Packs. Great game!!!"", ""I really enjoy this game. Intresting story line, lots to do lots of customizations. I want to see more for character customization. Definitely earned 5 stars! The only thing I had a problem with was ads either not playing or the app would close when I click on the option to double rewards. Map never changes add some new locations pls it's like 10 years since release and the maps the same."", ""This game had so much potential but there is absolutely nothing to do that motivates me to want to do it. Just look at GTA San Andreas, it has stats and you can actually rob stores with a police chase, you can go to the gym to change your body type and eat. This game shouldn't be the same thing but it should improve off of it. And the missions are a mess in my opinion, there's no direct story exactly and very disorganized with too many points on the map. A new game should be made if possible."", ""This is a beautiful game, however... Unfortunately, its one of those games that instead of making it a challenging game, they've made it challenging to do anything in the game. Most of the cars are reduculously difficult to drive without smashing into everything, and its the same when you're just running around. It's stupid how difficult it is to drive and run. It's just a really frustrating waste of money, as this game REALLY sucks, if you don't cough up some real cash."", ""This mobile game is one of the best open world mode that i ever tried. To experience fully the game you will need vip levels, that let you unlock special items. But as always we find somtimes issues with it, one for example, in ad rewards, doesn't work, specially the interactive ones, another issue is the respawn cost, and the last one that I found recently is that shadow effects were removed since last update. Good game overall. I wish it had a online mode though."", 'I like the game. I just think that you can make some adjustments to the game. Like for starters make the police harder. Everytime I go into the military base I get out of there fast and the police are behind but then I shake them quickly. And there needs to be more muscle cars. I think like the dodge charger and challenger. I think you should also be able to modify cars. Like the appearance. And the performance.', 'Perfect Graphics & Good Story and Physics. I wish I could play this game with my friends or my gang in the same map. But I think this is a pay-to-win & pay-to-play game. Some missions are even so hard that you have to try again so many times to cheat or find a way to pass them. This game takes a little time to progress, But my progress is 30% till now.', 'The game is great but just one problem and that is FPS. If you add FPS that would be amazing and just wonderful. Also could you add new graphics like HD or Ultra but if you already have those could you upgrade them like GTA graphics. And it would be great if you put in multiplayer so you can play with other people and see them in the game. Thank you for all the hard work you put in to making these games.', ""the game can be fun and halarias. but there are some things that are REALLY anoying. First... you cant just respawns. you have to watch an ad or pay ingame money. But if you run out of ads to watch and money to spend you have to quit the game and go back on it. So please fix that. And another thing is that sometimes when I watch an ad to get a reward and I'm finished with it I dont get the reward. Please reply and fix the game."", 'I wish that similer to the xbox game there would be a greater map. Not just that though i wish that they can also change their map. This game is really good but ive been playing it for years and there is not really much change. Also make it so when you kill a cop or army guy you can pickup their . Also something that should be added is a house. It is fun and you can walk around. Lastly I wish that you can get a diffrent charecter. Great game but it can improve.', ""Everything was great but when it comes to the controls, it really just gets bugged out. I also just wasted a bunch of medkits because I was stuck in one position and couldn't move while the swat team was just shooting me until I basically died. Cam is horrible as well as the controls. Everything else was fine but I still would not recommend this game."", ""Controls are so vague it's next to unplayable, autotargeting switches while in the middle of shooting to targets far away instead of the closest. And enemies don't drop ammo so in the middle of a mission you'll run out and be down to fists and a bat against sub-machineguns. Plus the ads really break up gameplay, I understand an ad to revive or to get a bonus but every time you open a menu? Great idea but poor execution."", ""This is a excellent sandbox game similar to the GTA Series for Mobile. I read past reviews complaining about it missing some features or dynamic effects and some other stuff. However I love the game the way it is, Mobile devices aren't meant to handle so much in the game since Mobile devices aren't meant for strictly gaming. 5/5, keep up the good work."", ""the latest update the graphics have went to an all point low which was one of the best things about the game! and now everything is harder to come up and the whole new layout design of the city really sucks and is disappointing uninstalling! I've had this game for years and watched all the updates that made it such an awesome game but this has really brought the value of the game down, sad."", 'finally got started playing & i cant stop lol. theres endless fun to do, aside from the fun of doing whatever you want in the open world youve got missions, events, SOOOO many rewards and me loveee rewards. the shop is filled, always updated. you never get stuck, and even when you do it doesnt last long. you get new stuff and more to do once you come back youre no longer stuck cause you got better equipment & it only takes 10 mins of gameplay. i love this game, its really great.', ""I think this is one of the best open world games that ever came out for mobile. I don't mind the ads that pop up randomly since you get rewarded with every ad you watch. I only gave this game 4 stars because I noticed it will crash at random times. It is no big deal, still a really enjoyable game and time killer."", 'Gameloft SE have done a great job updating the game through the years. I love how earning DIAMONDS is now BALANCED. The gameplay is also very fun such as MISSIONS, satisfying car explotions, and the new weapons and vehicles in the game are really cool too. However I have analyzed the flaws of Ganstar Vegas over the years... Suggestions: 1. No AD interruptions. At times while doing a missions the game plays an AD causing you to lose. 2. Add MULTIPLAYER. This would mulitply your downloads.', ""I think in terms of story, it's amazing. In terms of graphics? Decent. In terms of Dialogue? Great. All around all it needs is faster loading and better animations for Speech and Driving. And a fixed camera on the player. But all around.

For example, I think the general player base would like to be able to start unlocking all of their spirit jars at once, instead of just one at a time. Also, the energy system is horrible. Either give us a higher maximum, make it regenerate faster, or just get rid of it pls. I'm not a fan of the fact that my equipped weapon changes between story missions sometimes."", ""This game is aight, it could be better. The resolution in the game is pretty bad and i can barely see the letters or words in the game. I don't know how to fix the resolution in the settings. It doesn't have the best controls either, like when I'm trying to escape the cops it would be hard to turn or even control the car. Besides that, the game is ok, althought it could be better. Maybe update it a little and add better controls and resolution, and ill give it a 5! 🔥"", 'this game is great! I like it alot, but pls remove the forcefield on the cars, like add a switch to turn it on and off because, when they drive, crashing into them, i wanna see the cars damage, i noticed that when u crash into the car its like a forcefield and a gap between the cars, but only your car takes the damage, not the drivers car, pls add something like a switch to turn it on and off pls, overall its a great game, 4 star, i will update my review after and put it 5 star after', ""Game is really good. But the controls are awful. The auto aim is mind numbingly horrible. The motorcycle controls are a little less than the worst nightmare you can have. Why make it ridiculously hard to steer the motorcycle? It's literally impossible to turn while driving at a higher speed you hit the control and it doesn't work. Why make it nearly impossible to make a simple turn?"", 'This game is Awsome! The only thing that I think could be better is the cars. when you get a car the only thing you can customize is the color. I wish you could for instance put a lift a giant tires on the tucks. And the sports cars I wish you could change the tires or hot like a spoiler or something like that. Other than that the game is awesome!.!', ""The game as usual is amazing, but there should be a feature to play offline. Love the weapons it has alongside with the vehicles it has. And also the graphics. Used to be better back then, but almost as good as today's graphics. The cel-shading really catches my eyes. shame it can't be offline. Gangstar vegas is offline, but not this one. My internet connection is terrible, and sometimes, I lose connection despite the fact this game is completely offline. But still, the game is good."", ""It's an okay game. Controls and stuff is fine, aside from shooting. The button seems like it is letting you aim, but it's actually the shoot button. I wish there was a way for me to aim so I could shoot from a far distance. I also wish there was a way to do things stealthily. It really only gives you one way to do things and that's it. It needs more options, and maybe a more customizable experience with the player character. Maybe both a guy and girl option and a way to change the colors too"", 'Very amazing game super fun and addictive!!! My only real gripe is the lack of controller support which is even more infuriating to know that theres a version for PC and it supports the xbox controller!!!!! If it had controller support on mobile and the ability to toggle the sirens on and off I would easily rate this game 5 stars! Second less intense issue is I hate the fact if you are just exploring around you cant select to holster your gun its always in your hand and very annoying.', 'There are immovable buttons next to the fire button for grenades/health that will cost you diamonds, accidentally, constantly. This is atrociously exploitative. The map is huge and looks great. I wish there was more to do as the campaign is very short and simple, to the point that you wont use most things in the game. Awesome guns! The ads in the game are extremely excessive. The controls+AI in the game are abysmal...0/5. A lot of hard work was put into this game, but in the wrong areas. Pity.', ""Doing missions unlocks quarters, but for some reason they don't stay unlocked. Also watching videos will unlock extra slots for soul jars that don't stay unlocked. The customizations say that when you own a quarter you unlock certain gear or vehicles and that doesn't happen. I'm not sure what you were going for on this one but I'm not changing my review until you start making the game work the way that it should. I'm using a Galaxy Note 8, just in case you think my phone is the problem."", 'This game is great, it doesnt seem like a GTA game but more like a Saints Row game. Im having an issue though, after you upgrade your mansion for the first time, it brings you to a map screen. After it brings you to the map screen a window opens up allowing you to claim rewards for 7 days. After i collect the first day, the window disappears and a new one opens that has a menu. So i cant select anything on the map because another screen is blocking the map. I would love to play it more.', ""This is a fun game there's a lot of tasks for you to do and different types of tasks, different types of weapons and different types of vehicles. You have different locations you can gain control over. The only issue is there's always some type of problem with the connection no matter how strong your Wi-Fi or your data are there is some sort of constant reloading and then on top of it there a lot of advertisements even in the middle of quests you're doing that cost you energy"", ""There are so many problems with the game 1. When you're in a vehicle, your weapon stops functioning sometimes 2. Ads keep popping up even during missions, and some of the ads end up taking away the sound from the game or it won't exit 3. The vehicles also sometimes loses function while you're drive it (the steering loses function) 4. The amount of times I've fallen off my motorcycle just by barely hitting a wall. The game is great but it still needs a lot of fixes."", 'This game is really fun to play!! It\'s got the whole Story Mode within it, as well as optional missions and even open-world freedom to just run around and terrorize whoever you want. This is the only game I\'ve found so far that comes anywhere close to a ""GTA-like"" experience. The various customizations include everything from painting your cars, changing outfits, Decorating your ""mansion"", and other buildings on your property. This game has a cool story, & an open-world!', 'Overall this game is frustrating, the ad placement is horrible, an ad would pop up in the middle of your screen mid fight/car chase. The auto aim is quite bad , their would be a guy right in front of you and it would lock onto a guy behind a brick wall. Some missions require certain weapons to play but your lucky if the crates give them to you. Story is good but this game needs improvement', 'This game is epic!! I mean, graphics are great, the story is great and the game is realistic. This is my most favourite Gangstar game so far. Keep up the good work guys. The only thing I\'d say is a bummer is that the story is kinda short. I finished it in only 2 days (about 5 hours each day). Its kinda pointless changing anything now because the story being short doesnt change the fact that its such a cool game. So again i say, ""Keep it up Gameloft"".', 'Game almost forces you to pay or watch ads. Worse, the ads freeze up on the screen forcing you to restart the app and potentially lose your progress. Additionally, you only get 20 energy and as you level up, the energy lvl stays the same but missions can cost up to 11 energy, 4 minimum. So progression is extremely slow and painful. Again, it essentially forces you to pay to get any enjoyment. Several bugs cause interactive icons to not work and ads that cause the game to lose sound.', ""Pretty good game overall. It can get slow sometimes if you aren't willing to pay to play. But you can watch a bunch of ads to get diamonds and energy some of the time. My biggest issue is how long it takes to open spirit jars. Some take 12 hours. It makes it hard to level up and get upgrades. If all your slots are full, you can't get new jars when you complete new missions. So you just have to wait or miss out."", 'The map is insanely big for a mobile sandbox game, and the performance is surprisingly stable given the map size and graphical quality. Only takes about 1gb of memory as well. The gameplay has improved vastly over past iterations. However, microtransactions are pushed quite a bit and can even get in your way of playing sometimes.', ""Not the best. The controls arent the best and I feel like the graphics are cartoon looking. I'm on a s10 plus so its deff not my phone. However the good thing about this game is the idea to have territories you can own. I haven't dug too deep into it but I know you have rivals or something. Instead all we need is free roam multiplayer similar to the Modern Combat online system."", ""Great game. Awesome layout of city, I really like the detail to landmark locations! I dropped to one star because the ads have become ridiculous... anything you do an ad pops up.... I rated 5 star when first downloaded had minimal ads...but this has become stupid! If you don't want people to play your game just say so... an advertisement every screen switch is a bit excessive and only reason I haven't deleted is because I hope it will be looked into and fixed."", ""I loved this game! When you can't buy GTA, this is totally worth the 2GB. The story is bad, yeah, but it's still enjoyable to run through the city driving cars and having fun, doing the missions every now and then. My only complaint is with the recent addition of ads. Very disappointed with that."", 'The reason i still wont rate this five stars is becaause of this energy system! This game had/has a problem with saves. I have tried to start over many times, including one I have used for almost four years. It is too time consuming for me to PROGRESS on this game and even harder for me to play it know my time and effort was wasted! Most stuf that I think should cost energy does not, like zombies. But other essensial things like challenges and story quest do? I\'d like ""ENERGY"" to be revoved.', ""I had a gang star game before when I paid for it then it suddenly became over the years. It put bugs on my previous tabs and phones causing them to shutdown and act weird until it was removed from the device. I played this for a minute and it had a glitch... turned itself off. I didnt mind but since it did it once I really dont know what to think since the other one is full if bugs. I dont know what's going in with gangstar games but they arent recieving good reviews. Experience has taught me more than once. Would love to play these but never again. Gs8plus"", ""Honestly, I love the game, it's very, very well put together. Why the 3 stars? Opening chests is actually a deterrent to playing, that and the energy to start a quest. I get that's how they make money, I get it, I really do. If they would move the decimal one place to the left, I would probably spend 50 or 60 bucks (if they didn't have the energy and cheat timers). This game could be phenomenal without those three issues."", ""The game is good. Well optimized, decently fun, graphics are great. But you can't play it. You have very small amount of energy and missions take a lot. To progress you need to open jars, which open for at least an hour. You also can't open them simultaneously and there are only 2 cells for jars, for additional two you need to watch ads. For energy you need to watch ads. It offers very little gameplay, but make you watch ads all the time. I would prefer having an option to buy the game instead."", 'Unlike it\'s predecessor, Gangstar Vegas, it has a different storyline, a different map and better graphics, and that\'s great! The openworld part of it just doesn\'t seem that ""plentiful"", there isn\'t much to do or go to besides the storyline unlike Vegas, and it\'s been like that ever since it\'s release. It unusually requires internet even though there isn\'t really a feature which requires connectivity. The main highlight really is a new storyline, and fine that\'s good, but it could be better.', 'No doubt this is a rly good game. I mean the animation for every takedown, stealing cars, stealing bikes etc is amazing. All I wanna say is add the bike starting animation every time I get into the bike and also pls give us more energy, I run out of energy by just doing 2 missions. Bugs are very present (I ran into 2 bugs in the tutorial itself.) But still good game', ""I love the game but it needs internet connection to play it unlike gangstar vegas. Not just that, it has so many glitches and sometimes it's pretty laggy for my phone which has an android version of 8.1.0. I hope this will get an update that fix the glitching and I hope that this will be an offline game. The story is not that good, the game is very easy and the missions is not too many."", 'Gameplay is nice, but the stick controls are So bad. Failed the boat missions due to beaching due to poor steering. The left and right arrows are way better. The quests are also broken, the ""complete defense missions"" get accomplished only on some defense missions. For example, of the two madisonville defense missions only one count for the quests. The ads are also very intrusive. I know these are essential, but find a way of injecting it in the game with less disruption of gameflow.', ""Great game ,but so so many problems. Why have ads if they can't load the ads , can't move or customize the controls, moving around is simple but full of flaws, there is so much wrong but it's fun would like more energy yes but they have to give us more options with setting and customizes"", ""Awesome game!!! But there seems to be a problem when I reach the level with the Voodoo Queen: after I've eliminated the security guards outside and inside the house, the screen just goes black, like it's loading for the next scene, but nothing happens... I can, however, hear sounds in the back ground, but doesn't matter how long I wait, nothing happens. So I'm basically stuck and can't continue with the game without finishing this level. Please advise??? Cause I want to finish it? Thanks!!!"", 'Definitely deserves 5 stars. This is probably one of the most generous games that I have ever played. I was rewarded very handsomely for my grinds. I already own a handful of 5-star items as well as claimed 7 turfs, all in just about a week. However, I ran into a few issues which hampered my progress. The one that bothers me most is the lack of responsiveness of the acceleration pedals and the left arrow of the vehicular controls. This always made me lose out in vehicle missions. Please fix.🙏🙏', ""The game is good, they fixed the jar issue but the boats are impossible to use, I can barely win with boats because of the controls, can't you just add the same control options for the cars and motorcycles to the boats because they are so hard to use plus some time my interactions with the buttons don't regester, I know it's the controls that are the problem because I find the car and motorcycles controls really good. I'm not tring to hate on the game, it's really good and I highly recommend it."", ""Definitely a step up from Gangstar Vegas in terms of microtransactions and replayability. Story's a bit short, but at least you can finish this one without paying for it. E Man was a nice surprise too. And the turfs and spirit jars, combined with the quests, ensure that there's always something to do, but you won't spend too much time here. Also, it's a very generous game. Thank you guys, Go Gameloft!"", ""The game has some glitches, the handling is kinda difficult making it even more harder to make missions, the storyline was too short and the ending was too disappointing. Although, it's still really fun to play in free roam, the game still has it's potential but it still can be improved and it would be one of the best games in mobile."", 'The game is top class. Its just amazing. There is only one suggestion to give, which is that the energy given is only 20 and very less. I think this should be upgraded to atleast 50. It is very hard to keep control on more than 2 turfs at a single time. I cannot play the game everday and every now and then. This is the only upgrade the game needs in my point of view. Please do this because than it will be easier to keep more turfs under control.', ""This game is solid! i love the cutscenes, giving a sort of cop-criminal action show from the early 2000's type of vibe. The only major criticism I have is that graphics. There is nothing wrong with them as a whole, they're actually really good for a mobile game. The only problem is that for some reason the resolution is really low for me, and it seems there is no option to change that. My screen is1080p, but the game runs at what looks like a crappy PSP LCD display. Is there a fix? Thanks!"", ""Overall this is a great game. But I have to say the limitation of the energy really awfull. What's the point increase your level if the energy limit stay 20 forever. For the new upgrade it's also made me confused, it's ok if you want to build mansion instant, you need to use the mansion currency. But if you want to build normal, it would be better if you give an option to using the dollar."", 'Great game and all, but I suggest two changes. Maybe change the shooting style to a different one, such as in Call of duty, PubG, or something like that. The other suggestion is just to add more interaction with businesses. We could teleport there and go inside, and maybe even sleep or summon cars. Please take these ideas into consideration, mainly the first one.']",False,"['com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftGGHM', 'com.streets.fire.grand.gangster.city', 'com.sozap.badmen', 'com.hgamesart.crimedriver', 'com.gta.truck.driver.city.crush']","['com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA9HM', 'com.gameloft.anmp.sniper.champions', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDMHM', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA8HM', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDOHM']",com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftOLHM,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftOLHM&hl=en&gl=us

The graphics are good it's easy to manage has tutorials to make sure you understand what the hell is going on and even has a somewhat interesting story. There's only one problem though, which is overtime like as you progress through the game it gets more tedious and like you have to wait days on it and just to get one thing done. Which leads to another problem, being that it's a bit too pay to win of an experience. Edit: Another issue, you cant use multiple devices."", ""Very fun and well-developed game. Its strategic yet relaxing. Doesn't get boring as you progress because there are lots of new fighters, buildings, features, and so on to unlock. The difficulty is very well balanced, you won't get tired of fighting easy enemies and you won't be constantly overwhelmed by prestige players. You play against people that are near your level. Loads of fun, well rounded game, highly recommend."", 'The game is great. I have a lot of fun, but I am coming across a big when it comes to specialization of boosters. I was trying to get the production specialization, but everytime I clicked it, I would get something else. I noticed it earlier as well with other specializations. I got the specialization I wanted, eventually. But it ended up using an un needed amount of medals to get it and about 5 - 10 taps/clicks. Please fix this.', ""It is a fun game but after playing for three days now it does have issues. For instance buying a plot of land. Exiting game then when you come back it's gone along with your money. This is just not on plots of land either. It's on everything you purchase. It keeps wanting to synchronize even though I'm using only one account. You lose what you bought when it's done."", ""I used to play this game back when it was first released. It's good to be back but I find that I take longer to load certain things. For example, after I defeat a player and want to evade his base, it takes really long for it to load their base. Sometimes it's doesn't even load at all and I have to close the game and restart not again. By the time the he loads back up I get sent to my base without ever raiding the enemy player."", ""I love this game but they can't seem to deal with all the bugs. I got it when it first came out and played all the time. After all that work I came into the game one day and it had restarted and I lost all my progress. I loved it enough I played through it again. Same issue. That happened a total of 3 times at this point. I've just now given it its last chance and am stuck. It says to click the coin icon which its not allowing me to do. Save yourself from the headache that is this game."", 'Great game. Only reason not 5 🌟 is the game is constantly out of sync & I loose progress almost daily. Otherwise I enjoy the game play & speed of the game & upgrades. Good time killer. Update on my review. Game is still very out of sync. Now it tries to sync during a battle & I loose the win & reward or I instantly loose because it synced up finally. Still a fun game but sucks consistently loosing progress. Update again lol. Still very out of sync but still fun. Out of sync still badly 7-24-20', ""Unique to my knowledge. You do have build timers but can set as many builds as you can afford/power so that can save a ton of time. You can grind to your heart's content, you do need fuel for combat but you can very easily make enough to go just about non stop. Events are fun and don't require spending to do well just good old fashioned skill and sometimes grind time. All in all a fantastic game. Only negative = it can be a bit of a pain having units die after so long, but it isn't a big issue."", 'My only gripe is it never gets any updates , the update yes/no screen you sometimes see is a bug , if you tap yes it crashes and you have to re-install. Over the last year it has become overun by hackers , new players now log in and the first thing they say is how do i hack. my main account is 7 years old , my new one is 4 month old. A storage facility like in war planet would be good idea. A lot of good friends in the game have helped me through personl difficult times over the last 2 years.', 'The game has a lot of problems. You build up plenty oil and then it just disappeared. Too much syncing in which you lose the battle ,any rewards and other resources. You set up a battle and then the game freezes and you need to restart the game. Annoying pop ups keep appearing telling of insignificant achievements from weeks ago. Problems from 4 years ago have not been addressed. The customer services is of no use whatsoever where you NEVER get to complain or mention problems.Nobody is there and', ""3 times in a row my progress reset. First the game crashed after I hit level 4, progress lost. The second and third time the game flashed into a loading screen and said your game will now be synchronized, progress lost. I shouldn't have to play the tutorial 4 times in 15 minutes"", ""Game play is not always smooth, a lot of loading, and to many players that cheat , but GL does nothing about that,be warned!!!! Game play is even slower now the game or the server is constantly shutting down and kicking you out of the game so frustrating 😑and they keep asking to rate how lowsy the game is,for something so addictive they don't care if it runs like it's supposed to☹"", ""Better then clash imo, stuff doesn't take forever to build/upgrade and units last for upwards of 12 fights each played this on multiple phones/accs (never had an actual acc save till now so had to restart each time). I also love the aesthetic of the game"", ""The game is good, the graphic is also. But After 1 day of playing the game, it is not loading anymore. When you start the program it is writing ' checking the updates ' but the status bar of loading is not going further, nothing is happen. After waiting some period going to delete the game. A lot of lost the time."", ""Requires your location to play? No thank you. Other games need it but give you the option of having it on. This doesnt. If you dont agree to give your location you wont progress at all and will be reverted back to when the game asked you for your location. All progress you've made would be lost when you get off the game for even 1 minute. Very disappointed"", 'Absolute waste of time and energy. Constantly resetting and losing all progress. Collect money and build something. 1-24hrs later you start all over again. No point in trying.', ""This game is great and all and I would give 5 stars but....... but the crashes and game data synchronization where it gives the popup is annoying. Please fix this! I have just been crashing way too often right now I can't get on without crashing and my phone specs are enough to run this game...."", ""This game is not poor-user friendly... It requires an insanely high internet Just speed start the app... If you have an average of 1mbps internet speed you will have to be patient... I don't know how or why but PUBG works just fine on my phone and I deleted it for this game and it's already 24hours it still didn't start... You have to see the 'Downloading' screen three times one after the other..."", 'Addictive, but has a few flaws that could make a person disinterested in a while. For example, it takes way to long to progress through the levels. Also a bit confusing about how to do certain things, and not enough in-game options to get help or info.', ""Very bad experience. Your server connectivity is ZERO Every 2 minutes, game will disconnect. Also, I hate that every 5 minutes game synchronization. Can't it synchronize in the background? It sucks!"", 'I do enjoy the game, however it frequently freezes in mid game costing me the battle at times. Further to this it also sycronises in mid battle as well, if in Global Conflict the battle and control points are lost. I am also aware that the game does not always record a successful breach. Fix these and I will give 5 stars.', ""Too many bugs, Gameloft is a quality game company i don't know what happened to this one. When attacking under water some a lot of times buldings appears not in the construction area and you cannot steal money. Sometimes when you try to fuse your army it takes your money and game goes in synchronizing. When you grow in level sometimes you have to restart the game, and more other once i've found Prometeus building in the middle of my base. Same on you Gameloft very disappointed . Zero stars"", ""love the game since I started playing it in 2013 and love that it fully online , but the only problem i have now is that I have reached a particular point in the game where there is a new technology and i can't even play that part ( taking too much time to load ) . anyway still love it thanks GL"", ""Played this game years ago on my Windows phone. It's a good fun game , but was full of hackers then, like one person is level 27 he only has 1 tile yet he has loads of units. So it seems to be full of them now. Game freezes sometimes when I've tried to invade after a battle , I'm from UK and no union flag so have to play as American"", ""In general a good game and I have fun playing it solo. I have found occasional glitches in their interface. Biggest issue I have is that there is a lot of cheating/hacking going. When you play it don't expect to win first place in global events as the hackers will take the top positions."", ""I instantly disliked this game as we are forced to play as 'america', I'm English. The gameplay itself is also terrible and it is not a fun game at all. It may not help that I have seen extremely similar games before this one... The only reason I'm giving two stars is for the graphics, that's it. Overall, don't install this unless you are really desperate for a game like this and you've tried all the other similar games, but if you haven't tried the other games, they're much better in my opinion"", 'The game is very buggy. Now Im at a point where my barracks wont stop producing the same marine. Once complete it syncronizes the game and takes me back to the point i was at when I first cued it up for production. In other words I cant play for more than 6 minutes and 30 seconds before the game resets back to that moment. Im done.', 'So far have had good experiences with game. Some bugs. Would not purchase with real money at this time as purchases for items do not stay in account. Added base expansion with 40000 purchase. Funds reduced and shows timer.

Also the it takes a long time to load and crashes happen often', ""Overall it is a good game exept for the fact that I was banned TWICE for using something provided by the game, Im playing on a computer and it offers touch drive or something and apparently you can't use it in multiplayer and I was banned and had my progress reset. If you will ban players for using something in multiplayer don't let me have the option to turn it on for multiplayer, game support doesn't work and I have no way of contacting them since their customer support doesn't help with game"", ""I would rate 5 but I can not help. I play games thorough my pc and android phone. but I can not link my mobile game to my pc games. its irritating that two device has different two progress. why it don't have option to connect two different device, why I need another windows environment to sync. its lame."", ""A huge fan of this game but then the made me delete this game on windows device as the reset my whole progress from level 90+ to level 1. Now have downloaded it on android and found the progress cannot be transferred to different platforms. I hope they should have worked over it Now issues on android devices. 1.

During this two issue when i force close the game, i lose my money made from any invasion before the issue kicks in. Tried going to the Gameloft forum to get technical support but i was unable to even post a issue as i didn't found any option to create a post or submit a complain on their forum.

Plus, I upgraded a car and when I tried to restart it, all my upgrades I just used disappeared! Very upsetting. Needs a little fixing here and there."", 'Great game with great graphics and variety of cars, but the steering sensitivity is a little too touchy. I was at zero without steering assistance and I have to jerk my device around to keep straight, crashing into my opponents and going off-course. Even if I increased the sensitivity, the slightest turn would send me to the wall. Also, I have the same problem about the game going twice as fast sometimes.', ""Disappointed. Not horrible, not up to potential either. I have excellent wifi at home. Every day I get races that freeze mid race. Almost every day I get races that glitch in super fast mode. For a game that puts adds up for every single switch of screen or car, I'd expect at least to be able to win or loose on my own without glitches doing it for me. That said, the potential of this game is huge. Enough so to keep me checking in. Dont expect cash purchases while pushing ads every 30-90 seconds."", ""Well it's not bad, but it's no Gear Club or even NSF. The graphics are pretty good, but man-o-man those controls are absolutely brutal. I'm using the tilt control with accelerator and brake option like I do in all of my mobile racing games. It seems like I barely tilt to the right and woah! I have to immediately do a left correct for oversteer. Pretty much the same for tilting slightly left. The game needs steering calibration or something. I don't think I'll be playing this one too long."", 'Great racing game, real cars, modern and vintage, good balance between simulation and arcade. Technically superior, graphics, sounds... A bit too hungry for cash, though, so be prepared to grind for hundreds of hours if you don\'t want to spend real money. And, yeah, a lot of cheaters exploiting glitches in tracks (""shortcuts""), and getting 50 seconds lap times where it takes around 1:05 for well versed drivers seem to ruin it for everybody. Apart for that, a nice overall gaming experience.', ""Just awful execution of what could be a great game. Nice to see an accelerator in the game, driving is pretty good, just too many ads, Facebook login to a pint of blood and I still didn't get my progress back. I received what might have been the money I had, but not the in game progression (cars, stars, events, etc.) Not to mention the issue with trying to download and install (waiting on wifi...)."", ""It was a good game but I think Gameloft abandoned it, the updates quit coming and it got kind of boring. It had beautiful graphics and it never lagged, there wasn't many ways to modify the cars and you had to pay money for almost everything if you wanted to actually win. Most the cars were real money of just so expensive they weren't worth buying."", 'I used to play this a good deal on the Google Nexus Player (remember that device?). Before my progress was completely wiped out, I thought this was a very decent ""simcade"" (some people hate that word) racing game. A certain configuration I discovered made the RWD cars handle better than default. Great looking graphics and fairly okay music make this a fine game. It has a decent car selection as well. This is not the best mobile sim racing game, but it is far from the worst.', ""Wow gameloft, i played the first race and deleted it. It not even about the good graphics anymore. Us consumers want good game play. Unfortunately this game does not have that. Controls are very slow to respond. Car acceleration does not feel right or sound right, and the choice of first car? Really? GARBAGE!!!... I'll just stick with real racing 3. Way better gameplay."", ""Audio needs sweetened. Handling isn't terrible but some response times seem to lag. Maybe allow a little more performance abilities like tune settings. I.e. tire pressure, turbo psi, cosmetics ,maybe even tire wear. I rate 5 because I'm a Gran Turismo nut. the tracks are well laid out. Being in control of the car by turning off the assists. I can't stand to have the car stop itself. .what's the point of ME playing then ya know lol More can bevdone here, but it's definitely fun. Best MobileSim"", ""This is a good game, good graphics, decent controls and concept. But my reason for three stars is this the ads in this game are incessant. I get it, you need to make money on you game, but wow. I have no problem with ads, if that's your hustle, go for it. But why do I get an ad when I hit the pause button? Like why? Or at the end of the race, I hit continue, BOOM ad. Also, why do I HAVE to pay to fully upgrade my car? Oh yeah, 10 premium currency to max that puppy out. Still a good game. 3 ☆s"", ""I really like this game, but I had to give it three stars because EVERY CAR! Including me as well. EVER CAR! Speeds like 2X more than usually is, I've been playing this game for a while and it was fun. And so I want to make it to the levels everything started getting crazy... Like I said the car including me we're going 2X the speed then it usually was, and I'm not the only one who has this problem. Idk if it's my phone or not plus I don't have much space to talk so goodbye..."", 'Playing was great at first. But then I realized I could win every race simply by upgrading the brakes, engine, etc. At times the car in front of me simply slows down to let me pass and win. It is programmed in such a way that its not actually driver skill that wins.', 'Very nice game - the landscape, graphics, physics, design and overall car choices. But unfortunately, there is a bug that would always prompt me to use external control (joystick), everytime I will have to go to settings to select ""none"". Again there is no means of contacting the developer. Also vehicles don\'t upgrade at once, one have to wait for the other to complete upgrading.', 'Loads of fun! Only that the courses reminds me so much like the Asphalt series. Recycling maps perhaps? Nevertheless, an almost perfect game, much better than that ""other game"" where they say some players are cheating, and they tolerate it. If there are any changes I would suggest, is that I wish the Grid Display showing the inventory of cars, should also indicate which cars are still being upgraded.', 'April 2022 - 1 star - Latest update killed 18 months of progress, back to day one, lost 63 cars, 6 championships, and a pile of game money - not acceptable. Dec 2020 - 5 stars - So many events and championships thats its pretty easy to earn game money to spend on cars and upgrades. Great graphics and gameplay, lots of cars and tracks, controls are OK on a tablet, no download problems. It is one of the best Android racers.', ""This game its such a simple but elegant real racing simulator and i feels like im playing Grand Tourismo, easy to control, a good handling car, the ai are they'd challenging but there's a one little thing that bugz dont want to experience anymore is getting the animation was goin more faster likes a video fast forward hope u fix it as soon possible. Anyways 👍up this racing game and also you guys suggested to add more cars new and old muscle, tuner, supercars, and exotic. Thank you."", 'Its good game except for two things. The game randomly speeds up randomly, like it got hit by lightning or something (if you catch my drift). Please fix that. Another issue is that i cannot sign into Google, please resolve that as well. Otherwise its a great game, if anyone is reading. I recommend it. In fact i find it to be better than Real Racing 3. 😉', ""Playing the game for the first time you tend to struggle with the steering of the cars, but the more you play the easier it gets . The graphics are very good +great rewards on some of the track events. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to play it. Try it you won't be disappointed.PLEASE the cars are expensive and the upgrading time for stages 2 till 5 is to long,but it's a great game"", ""Electrifying and adrenaline pumping game. Nice graphics, great design and concept. However, as one progresses, the images start seizeing/hanging. I have freed my phone memory several times but issues persist; perhaps it's a developer problem. I hope this problem can be fixed and make this game a complete awesome experience one can ever hoped for."", 'Sharp graphics, very, very good game. The reason I hold back the one star is you cant steer further than 30* degrees, and that denies me a very important racing aspect. Also assisted braking is almost like a cheat. I can overtake on a straight track with assisted braking on but hard to do the same with it off. It should be like that on bends. Otherwise a smooth game.', 'It is very good... Especially the interior camera gives you a premium driving feel and I would strongly recommend installing it. (After all it is a Gameloft creation, what could go wrong). The only problem with it is that it you choose the steering wheel control... The moment you touch on the side the steering turns and is not proper. I would recommend the touch arrow controls or if you sir straight and play obviously the tilt control as it is the most convenient. Hope this review helps you.', ""The game is pretty impressive and challenging that's what I like about it. True the controls are difficulty but I'm used to them now. What I don't like about the game is the visuals are dull when you playing race events, the details are dull but when you viewing the cars you wanna buy they are so greatly detailed, so please add the same detailed reflection and shine that we see when viewing cars in our garage and shop(This game has potential to compete with Real Racing)"", 'Everything else is great except for the control. I don\'t use gyro often to control the car so i chose the ""Tap the side of the screen to steer"" control, because it is easier than the steering wheel control. But it comes with it\'s own difficulties like the brake that is disturbingly placed on the middle of the screen and can pretty much affect steering sometime (can\'t steer). If only there\'s a control similar to the steering wheel one but it is an arrow instead, that would improve this game.', ""Now I play this with my new device, and it's alot smoother gameplay than to my previous crappy phone. It just a little bit weird, because some games if have bugs the gameplay it lag too much. But this one the gameplay run too much faster like a speed of light. Anyway, I really like this game it's mixed of simulation and arcade race. Well it's like a Asphalt in a circuit race. Just add more cars in the future, or even race track. Pretty nice gameplay I can say."", ""nice gameplay, exciting challenges and events, cool music, so i can't get board, i havent tried the online events and multiplayer challenges but i'm sure it would be awesome, the events are easy to win, the only thing i dont like about the game is that it takes too long to upgrade a vehicle, mechanics are hard to find, and the cars become very expensive as the levels progresses."", ""Best car racing game I ever came across, graphics, controls setup all are on point, but as you go to a higher classes or level it becomes a bit difficult to buy car's, and the upgrades take so long once you hit higher classes or levels. And maybe if you can add more laps in the classic races, instead of only 1 or 2 , maybe 4 or 5 will be better."", ""Superb! Perfect for low end devices, amazing driving, nice car collection, meh upgrades(too expensive). Sad some good soundtracks have been removed, but the game doesn't struggle to be good, in fact I love it! Last thing: there are some minor bugs like the car that speeds when I press nothing or that it has revert steering commands and I have to go to the controls thing and manually change them over and over, luckily it happens rarely but it's seriously annoying. In the end, it's a good game."", 'Game and Graphics are greate, but developers should think of bringing some body kids and different sizes and makes od mag rims to game, and some decals to add some spice to car...make it more fun for the guys who like modified cars...give some points, or rewards for modified cars in there class. Also please add the different view from bonnet view wile driving. Otherwise game is excellent, and car sound effects are greate. Can really try consider these improvements.', 'Good game and excellent graphics, but consider minimising or compressing your update size when needed. This can grant most users the afordability. Equally, the cars drag a lot when moving or turning during race matches. All cars shouldn\'t have the same engine sound, unlike ""real racing 3"". I believe you can fix this. All the same, great job guys!', ""Developers, I loved the whole game... I liked how you guys added high-resolution textures for the road... But the reflection of the car's body and windshields(rear) should be different... And other things besides the road like skies, structures, hills, clouds etc should be improved to give equal graphical quality throughout the whole track... And also cars don't get darker when it is in dark places like tunnels... The car sounds can also be better...You guys should work on fixing that too... Anyway, I liked your game very much and that's why I wrote a long review... I liked this game very much... And if you all fix the above-mentioned issues this game might be perfect... 😁"", ""Well it's good, the graphics are fine I think (I have low end phone so I'm no sure) The cockpit are not really appealing and the car physics(?) suck, you can't bump your enemy and they are just in the perfect line, I always try to bump them but they are stick like a glue on the perfect line and sometimes its glitching when most cars are on narrow spaces, 2*"", ""Excellent graphics and great sound for a mobile game, but not having a proper scheme to drive with touch controls kills it make a scheme fully customizable with accelerator, brake, handbrake, turn, etc. the actual scheme are all bad! And no I'm not going to play with a controller, for that I play way better games on PC. The Always-Online-DRM it's a bummer too. (please note that I don't see any ads)"", ""I love this game, but there seems to be a new bug that makes it kind of unplayable. Halfway through a race, the game would suddenly speed up. Every animation both in the pause screen and the race is all of a sudden twice as fast. I've looked it up on youtube and found two other people having the same issue just yesterday."", ""First of all, I don't understand why people hate this game just because of it's sim-cade graphics. Gameloft has done a good job with the physics of the game and the quality of such a game coming from 2012 is just so underrated. The physics of the game is sim cade and is easy for beginners. New cars and new locations can be added too. Recently, there has also been a big in which the game runs in 2X speed. I hope the devs take care of this issue"", 'This game from my gameplay experience is absolutely awesome including the graphics and sound but the controls are kind of hard especially when you are turning. I have to slow down a bit for me to have a good turn maybe the ability to be able to drift might make the game to be realistic. But overall the game is really awesome and I recommend you to download.', 'Gameloft , you have a huge problem syncing game progress on Microsoft. you have also removed the ability to leave reviews on the store.I had to reinstall windows recently and when I reinstalled GT2 racing and both asphalt games all my progress was lost , there is no record of my progress. When I go to the website to log a complaint, the process is so convoluted with all the required fields, I just gave up. I deleted the apps and will not be playing again. Why should I start from the beginning.', ""I wish there's a higher graphics but i think it won't because of the mobile system,but it's all good ,you can keep grinding some coins,i recommend to play it... After a few minutes of playing the game,after my race ,it suddenly crash my game,it turned black screen and returned me to my home,my phone it's good at graphics and all my performance is good but this game the only one crashes"", ""The graphics is good, the steering realistic, the setting are realistic to but the downsides are why the upgrade time is long? Edit: Make the upgrade time a Little short, add more cars because in the previous version there is a supra and Lexus car and I don't know why you remove and I don't know why you remove the interior view please add that feature back it makes more realistic."", 'The ads are outrageously annoying and crashes the game several times. I mean, really? Ads in the middle of a race? And everytime we go back or advance to another screen, this spinning ball just pops up, then changes orientation from landscape to potrait, JUST TO SHOW THE AD. I know you guys need to show ads to make those papers, but at least do it in an honorable way, for example: the ""watch ads to get cash"" is fairly enough.

The graphics are cool but not great. The controller felt slow, unnecessarily slow, even when I had the sensitivity all the way up turning a corner legitimately took a second. It's not a real time bullet physics, like battlefield, meaning you shoot and wherever the cross hairs are instantly gets shot; like CoD. Recoil on the weapons seemed like none or very little. Not bad, but not great, for me."", ""Love the game. Just two issues so far. 1, I use to have this game and the picture was clear but after an update a while back, the pics been blurry. 2, I have to change my HUD settings on every single mission which is annoying. The original game set up isn't normal. Most people play with the fire button on the left, not the right."", ""The game needs an option to customize the game interface. Also known as customize the load out. The touchscreen buttons are in a bad place for game play in my honest opinion. There's too much aim problems with the layout like that and it should be up to the gamer to arrange the buttons in the settings menu. The left side of the touchscreen buttons need to be able to be customized as well. What should be an easy game to like isn't because the gameplay is way off as of now until developers fix it."", ""Pretty lifeless game. The graphics are good so is the campaign voice acting. But when it comes to movement it's not satisfying. Lack luster FX. When you sprint the camera auto zooms blocking the field of view from things in the environment. The player doesn't run very fast either. Aiming feels slow. No option to slide & turn. I guess I've just been playing cod so much my expectations are high. However I left cod mobile because of it's bugs. This game doesn't have bugs but..it just feels drunk."", ""Unable to get past the tower falling. Right after it falls, the game then proceeds to crash. I give it 3 stars due to the initial work put into the work (such as the intro scene, controls and more). Good to see people are still putting actual work in games. Would've been great if it didn't crash tho. :/"", 'Triple A rating! Absolutely, Amazingly Abysmal. I\'m playing on a Chromebook, and not a phone. Keep that in mind. About the controls: What controls? Fire button works, ""crouch"" button works. That thing on the lower left? Useless. I\'ve played C-64 games with WASD controls that were better. The tutorial: What tutorial. Hit the show me everything button and everything went right in the crapper. Got stuck in a corner and stayed there. You\'ll have more fun walking on glass in bare feet.', ""I give a 4. I think the Gamer Controller should be able to be customized. I wanted to swap the grenade and aim button. I wanted to also take the fire buttom on the left side off. Maybe it's the size of my phone, true, but still. I didn't fully get to experience or play the game and the only reason was solely the game needing a customize interface a.k.a. Customize Controller option."", ""In general, the game itself is great. The only gripe(s) I have is the security level on multiplayer. Too many people hacking the game or cheating. I'd also suggest making it a little cheaper when wanting to skip certain campaign levels. Being forced to pay to get to the next campaign level, due to not having enough stars, will result in alot of new users simply deleting the game by level 3-4. Some people will want to continue but, might not have the resources to do so."", ""Would give 5 stars, but the graphics aren't the best, the campaign multiplayer matching is totally wrecked, like, lvl 33 v max lvl 140 wrecked. I mean, this game's 5 years old, compared to a one to two year gap between the previous games in this franchise. The graphics aren't that great, there are a lot of bugs relating to movement. Optimize controls, graphics, add movement controls, like jumping . The game just cant do what you want it to. MC Versus just doesn't cut it, never did, never will."", ""It's a good game, great game play but multiplayer is a nightmare for new players and it shows way too many ads it constantly asks you do you want to watch a video for free credits or do you want to buy a supply drop, and then after a while it just automatically shows you videos without any reward. Campaign is fun though but I would suggest playing through it before going to multiplayer so you don't get absolutely crushed. Overall it's an okay game but it needs to be balanced out in multiplayer."", ""The game is great, high graphics, cool guns and armor and the gameplay is just great. I'd like you guys to change one thing: the autobalance in multi-player. I play multi-player all the time but the thing that annoys me the most is when I am doing so good for my team and getting a lot of kills, it automatically moves me to the opposing team and we end up losing. Please fix that feature because it isn't fair for the people who are playing good. Thanks! And great game! 🙂"", ""I have been playing this game since 2013. Its a great game with awesome graphics. With that being said, I am very disappointed with this latest update. The app keeps disconnecting and when I do manage to keep a stable connection I can't play multiplayer because it is stuck at 64% downloading map data. I hope the developers fix this soon. I have alot of money invested in armors, weapons, etc!"", ""Graphics are great and level of intensity is excellent. But I have a couple of concerns. (1) I felt like the storyline was too short. I wanted to be to kill Saunders instead of just him doing it himself. (2) Only one frag gernade. One frag isn't enough in a fight. (3) Online is unbalanced. Low level vs superstars who pay to win. That's crazy. (4) Controls. The aim button is a little close to the trigger. I cant complete certain goals because of that. Need to space them. 3 stars, my rating."", ""Pretty solid game. It feels like I'm back playing some of the older CoD games. Smooth graphics and game play. It's a lot of fun and challenging. Biggest pro is that there is built in controler support. However, adjusting the aiming sensitivity seems to do nothing on my controller (could just be my controller though). I do find that I have a hard time finding some stuff as its buried within certain menus. From just over the weekend it seems that its kept up to date as well."", ""Three stars due to the lack of control options. There's an option to play with a controller, so I decided to try it out. I played with my PS4 controller, the controls are mapped automatically, with no option to change it customarily. I can't aim down sights at all and I somehow shoot with the options button on my PS4 controller instead of R2 or R1. There should be an option to manually customize your controller mapping, or you guys should fix what you have by default."", ""Extremely rough game to get into, matchmaking needs work. Campaign is fun, and you can play for free but I wouldn't expect a smooth ride. Also, I'm not sure why but this game will sometimes make you aim off into nowhere. I play a few shooters on my phone using mostly the same UI and it's the only one that does it, so I'm fairly certain it's not a hard-ware issue. As a left-law player I would like to be able to move my map in the ui customization"", 'Game has great graphics and game play. HOWERVER, when playing multiplayer you aren\'t playing people in your same rankings, your playing against the highest ranking players. Not only is it riddiculous, it\'s impossible. I would love to play this so long as I can play and build within similar rankings. Also, 98% of the time the ads to boost your points are ""unavailable"" .', ""Graphics are amazing. Gameplay was great once I got my xbox controller dialed in. But, it constantly kept reconnecting, kicking me back to the beginning of the mission every time. I'm connected to a 5G network with basically zero wifi connections on it, everything is hardlined. at the very least, the campaign should be offline. Make the campaign offline and I'll bump to five stars."", 'Very good graphics and an impressive selection of not only guns, but grenade types too. I like the number of different classes to choose from but only a few really are of any real effeciency; most of the classes have a fun skill or look but are not really worth playing. A lot of achievements for beginners but then everything stalls and I am left with: mediocre hit detection, bland single player characters and story, many weapon upgrades which give no noticeable changes, and frequent crashes.', 'The game is fun. Unlocking weapons is satisfying and they give a nice amount of free credits. The controls are very wonky. Too difficult to aim even when i use a game pad. Sensitivity is on either sides of the spectrum of being too low or too high. Higher tier weapons are very overpowered. Developers need to finetune the controls and gameplay.', ""Its a great game but there are way too many ads. After every single loading screen an ad pops up. Even when there is no loading screen a random ad will pop up. But when you try to chose to play a video to increase your rewards there is a problem and the video will not play. Also there are ads that are popping up with no close button so i can't close them out. If you could fix this issue it would be great."", 'Upon loading the game states ""error, no internet connection detected"". There is nothing wrong with my internet connection. I have to tap ""ok"" a gazillion times before the game might start. Sometimes I can play for a while, then I get booted back to the same error screen. That is rare, however. The main occurence is during launch. I am using a samsung galaxy note 9. Please help.', ""It's a great game overall, but the controls could use some work, I personally play claw grip and when I already have a finger looking I don't think that when I start shooting it should make it so both fingers are looking around, it gets annoying and difficult to aim, if you fix this issue I will 100% rate five stars, but until then, you only get four from me."", 'it is getting fun to play,but a little confusing with too many options of menus when you go into weapons/loadouts. then its hard to tell if im using upgrades correctly so i have my most up to date weapon available because everytime i click on something it is always trying to get me to watch something or spend money. it just feels a little like you only want mine, or an advertisers money. other than that, its a fun game once you finally get down to it!', ""I've been playing this game for nearly 5 years, I'm level 132 willing around 160 hours playing, I have all the guns unlocked minus 1 or 2 prestige guns. I have all of campaign mode beat and was really hoping to see add ons for it, new guns, new maps in PVP, and maybe some new characters. I've spent about $100 over the past 5 years to get where I am but with some of the hackers out there it's not easy keeping up. other than that this game is very addicting and very fun!!!"", ""Wonderful game, I love everything about it. Something I'd want changed is the maps. I would love for there to be a massive map with at least a 20v20 where you're in the middle of a forest, henceforth allowing players (especially snipers like me) to feel the thrill of being able to sneak up behind someone without being noticed and having the same open to you. Also, within the forest to have some open spaces with buildings where snipers can go to to have a vantage point. Hope you read this. Thxs!"", ""Update: 1) They have a limited time event and their own pop-up has no dismiss button. Yiu have to close the app!! Complete BS. 2) Completing a campaign does not allow you to automatically continue., three stars on everything or use credits!! I played the iPhone version, which I bought over four years ago. That one had no third party pop up ads and I don't remember energy meters for the Campaign Special Ops missions; the B.S. credit or ads for the meters is horrendous."", 'The graphics are great. The game is great. I would even say it\'s addictive. One problem? The game, almost daily, disconnects from whatever server the notification is talking about. And, usually, when I\'m playing like a straight assassin in ""Battle Royal"" mode. Very frustrating. Frustrating enough to cut that 5 star rating to 3.', 'I would expect nothing less from Gameloft. Would rather give you a free game with lots of ads and microtransactions for every tiny little thing rather than a complete package for a fixed price. This is why people play games on something like an actual gaming console rather than a mobile device. It completely takes away from the experience when every other thing you do they are asking you to watch an ad. Appreciate the effort, but it still sucks.', 'Compared to other mobile shooting games, this one has decent graphics however the controls are not as refined as some modern shooters are for both the story mode and multiplayer mode. I understand that there are in-game purchases but what is with not being able to progress in the game if you lose ""power"" and in order to gain more of it is if you watch an ad or buy more power? That should not be a design in the game. I\'ve also noticed some lag in multiplayer mode when going against opponents.', 'a decent fps. worth the download. that being said. matchmaking is broken, while it\'s not p2w. They do put you in matches against far better equipped players with higher levels to ""encourage paid upgrades."" And the Adds are overwhelming to sell ""add free"" for a ""month"". a head shot can require several shots while a top tier weapon can kill instantly. So it\'s rather frustrating at times. but still fun to play. Just don\'t expect to be competitive without spending ""ALOT"" OF MONEY.', 'Over-all a great game but it crashes during the multiplayer loading screen frequently. Im running a brand new One Plus 7 Pro so I know its not the phone. Plz fix this and it would be 5 stars easy. graphix are stunning for a mobile game, game play is fluid, the controls are a little clumsy because you only have two thumbs to work with to move, aim and fire but they made up for it by allowing players to customize the UI.', 'Honestly not a bad game, my biggest complaint is the breach missions with the guys with detonators. It would make sense that if you shoot the guy in the head he would die but i guess not. You have to shoot the small detonator in his hand and if you shoot anything other than that you have to restart the whole mission. Really dumb but its a decent game.', ""The game is fun, but you couldn't tell that from all the hackers. I recently redownloaded it for nostalgia sake and the first multi-player match I played I was killed through walls multiple times by different people. Autobalance also moves you from a winning to losing team without any kind of buffer to your ratings when the team still loses. Overall, the campaign rocks, but multi-player is rotten until they learn to fix the hacks"", 'Didnt like the controls maybe I was too used to the option in call of duty but I liked being able to while aiming with one finger, shoot with the other or fire on the other thumb on the fly and walk and stride withered the other comes in handy being able to fire with either thumb. Didnt get to play anything but the tutorial part got could get used to the shooting tried to change it but no options to really change. Graphics are ok.', ""As a veteran of the Modern Combat series, I can say without a doubt that this is a substandard installment in the series. even the first modern combat had better controls. Visually, it's like an old (original) xbox game. yes I know that its mobile, but 4 at least had xbox 360 quality. while it does retain some semblance of its predecessors performance, it lacks Modern Combat's quality story that I believe many had come to love and enjoy."", ""Was enjoyable until i started getting matched with players three times my level. Sensitivity is too slow even when maxed, hit registration is terrible when it comes to headshots. For the campaign, the energy system is pointless, hit reg is STILL bad and you can barely tell if you're critically injured apart from the game telling you. I forgot why I didn't play this game anymore but after mistakenly coming back, I realize why. FOV is also weird on my phone and resolution is terrible"", 'I love the game gameplay is fun, one of the best games as far as mobile can go. However After downloading the additional files that are required, I started playing, but pretty quickly the game crashed and I had to redownload the files This happened twice and in total I wasnt able to finish 2 matches before I gave up and uninstalled. Please look into it? it could just be my phone, but if you even try to fix it ill bump the rating to five stars. thanks guys', ""I gotta say I absolutely love this game. The controls are smooth and progression doesnt require paying so that's definitely a plus!! That being said I didnt give it full stars. For one big reason.....ads....I mean I get you gotta get paid for this as a free app but cool it down a bit. I mean I get absolutely spammed with them. It interrupts the server so I have to reconnect constantly. Please cool them down a bit"", 'Very disappointing. Game detects my controllers, bluetooth and usb, but the only thing that works is the B button. All of my controllers are XBox styled controllers. More and more people are playing these games on Android TV boxes but you still insist on wifi internet connections instead of just checking for any internet connection.

Please stop using 1) targeted ads, or at least offer an option to opt out; and 2) ""GET""-sponsored ads; they are getting increasingly longer with extending timers added on, some are auto-launching Google Play or a browser, and a few repeat over and over redundantly and on a daily basis. It is making the game unenjoyable, and soon I will have no problem quitting the game permanently and moving on to something else. Thank you.', 'I love the minions and this game gives them all to you. I like the special abilities you get with each one! makes playa lot easier! I took one star away because i was unable to move my old account to my new phone and i lost EVERY ONE of my minions that i had earned and all of the upgrades i had made! I have to start from the beginning again and I had almost every minion available before i switched phones. What is the point of saving your game to the cloud when you cant get it back!!!', ""Since the last update, the game freezes or goes black in the middle of a run. That's if I can actually get to a room. Most times when i open it, it goes into an infinate hold and never starts fully. What have they done? Messed it up for me again! 12/02/21. Wow, now the face will not open sits at begining page an spins. SMH. Bug fixes bring more bugs. And still can't connect to server, lose extras after watching the add. Frustrating"", ""I really enjoyed playing this game. However the latest update is pretty frustrating. Missions speed up much quicker making it impossible to complete without spending tokens. I truly hope it's an oversight in the update and not the developer trying to make the players spend money. Also if you have a free power, I.e you run across a banana vacuum, the bananas you collect hardly count towards your recharge. Also did not fix issues with roller coaster bananas not counting and lag in Egyptian room."", ""Ads..ads..ads... Haven't played in a while, but the old game didn't have many ads and was a lot of fun. I got a new phone and downloaded this version which is not half as nice as the old one and too many ads. You play one or two levels there's an ad. I have uninstalled it and not even interested in playing again. You used to be able to sign in on Facebook and you have everything from before, this new updated version has no way to sign into Facebook. Very disappointed."", ""I don't exactly like the updated version I liked it when you moved up a level and it was in gru's lab and you were trying to fill and jar of jelly. I also liked it when they let you play until you died. Now after you complete the level you have to just stop playing like it forces you to. I know some people probably love this game but I miss the old one."", 'There are both pros and cons to the new version. I like the new version because it is easier to earn tokens. The old version didn\'t have as many lags. In the game, there is an ad that stops a second before it says it will stop (toy brick crush or something like that), making you either press it to go to the play store, or close minion rush and have to wait three minutes to get back in the game, and that ad usually pops up when you press ""watch ad to revive"". I will rate 5 stars when it is fixed.', ""I used to really love this game but for over a month now, maybe two months, it will not load at all! It just keeps saying that it needs an internet connection but my internet is working! What makes it even more annoying is that like once a day a minion will say something on my phone as a reminder to come play the game but I can't! It refuses to work! So I'm deleting it. I'm playing Hungry Shark Evolution instead! Unlimited play and it works great! Goodbye minions."", 'The new update killed all the good parts of the game, all old progress including purchases were lost for pennies on the dollar after assuring us that would not happen, the new graphics are terrible, and the new concept is confusing and hard to follow. Too bad the old game was great. Bad customer service as well. Not worth investing time or money into anymore. Seriously considering deleting it after years of playing.', ""Latest update ruined the game...I think the changes to the game's format are fine (though I like the old version of the special missions better) but the changes to the minions/costumes and power-ups are terrible. It sucks for people that spent so much time/money building up everything only for it to mean nothing now. We were supposed to get all our upgraded minions back but that's not the case. We got costume cards but enough of coins to truly upgrade them and they added the agent rank, which is another obstacle to upgrades to costumes. Anyways I could go on about this, but I'm sure this is falling on deaf ears."", 'What a disappointment!! I loved this game and played it often. Now everything I built-up over the years is gone, bananas, all the outfits with upgrades, the revives I had saved up, not to mention all the power ups. I feel like all the time I spent playing this game and saving stuff for a rainy day was a giant waste of my time because I have nothing to show for it now. I really hope the next update fixes all of this. So disappointed!', ""Good game, fun to play when you're bored. But it has a lot of ads, now it's not like most games where an ad pops up every five seconds, but it has ads. Also, when you're actually controlling the minion running, you don't get to run for a very long time. The goals are normally, 'collect 10 bananas.' As you can imagine, pretty easy. I would like the challenges to be harder."", 'I have been playing Minion Rush for years. The old version required skill to determine what to update, how to update, how and when to use items, and how to complete levels. I had over 15 million bananas, golden shield and a very large array of Minions to choose from that I had earned. The new version is on the verge of confusing. The ""transfer"" of items was garbage and what did transfer I still need to play, excessively, to even recruit due to ""upgrading"" needing banana tokens that you need to earn. Further, the ""transfer"" makes no sense. For instance the Cleopatra costume I had maxed out plus upgraded - which was I believe ~250% bananas collected, a free revive, plus double bananas after the revive. The same costume now simply increases the chances of getting a banana vacuum - completely losing the purpose of having, using, and upgrading that costume in the first place. I could go on but that is just one example. The gameplay while running is on the verge of annoying. The controls are sloppy by comparison (slow to react), game play at times will pause for no reason - and when it starts up again, the slow reaction is even worse and you almost always lose the run. Trying to figure out how the levels works just leaves the user confused. Use of items is even more odd, by comparison to the old, because there\'s no upgrading the item - each item has a very short duration unless that specific costume has been upgraded for that specific item.', ""This game used to be fun when the levels were there. The levels gave you like a challenge. And that challenge was, collect all the fruits to progress to the next level. But now, it feels like i'm cheating. And plus, it used to be alot more fun then the updated version. Now the app kinda sucks. Bring back the levels please. Then I will give it at least 4 stars."", ""Just another in a long line of games that baits you into playing a few easy levels, then gives you impossible missions that require the purchase of tokens for continues in order to complete. I even bought tokens to skip difficult missions only to be rewarded with even more difficult missions. Mainly they require the use of a specific power-up for a certain amount of time, then make sure not to put that power-up in the level long enough for you to die. Really frustrating for my kids who want to collect the different costumes but can't."", 'I used to play this a few years ago and got addicted to it. Felt like playing it again, but I don\'t like the changes at all. It used to be linear, with progressions through the rooms, but now I\'m all over the place with all these different goals, and limits on how much I can play. The power-ups are virtually useless in some instances. Ex: on a ""ride Gru\'s rocket"" challenge, I got the freeze ray maybe 20 times, but the rocket only once after running for ~10 minutes. It was much better before.', 'Minion Rush was a great game. WAS. The mission reinvention of the game makes it a bore. What made the Old Minion Rush fun was that it was endless and goes faster and faster until you bump into an obstacle. The items and costumes system worked awesome in the old version. They still work fine. But the overall mission system just spoils the fun of what used to be a great game. Please bring back the endless runner layout. It was more fun back then.', ""this used to be an awesome game before you removed the most basic functions the game used to have, mainly it was an INFINITE runner, where you didn't have to unlock maps (although you had to make it to a map change section.) The game didn't stop you run because you finished your task. You could run an infinite amount of times ( didn't have to wait for the tickets/energy/what-ever-you-call-it to replenish.) and there were BOSS FIGHTS! So far all i can say isthat the game lost its charm."", ""A few years ago I'd always play this game and I loved it, I decided to reinstall it. I try to play but it starts off with an annoying tutorial and so many missions. When the missions are accomplished then the run's over... that sucks. I can't do a run for fun anymore like the good old times, the player cards or whatever are dumb, I miss purchases with bananas and coins. The missions just loop, like i don't even know how many times I've collected 80 bananas for a mission. I miss the old version."", ""Great game with good graphics. It's more better playing on a mobile device than playing on a Apple TV. (yes, you can download games on it.) You get to unlock more items, characters, maps, etc. I just have a problem with one thing is that I get a lot of in-game notifications. Like, if I go to play a mission and then I come back to the menu after beating that mission, I get about like 5 notifications. I would just like for the notifications to just calm down."", ""The game definitely takes up too much storage. I liked that you can keep your progress from a previous download. The graphics were great! The game has a lot going on and I don't like the fact that you have to upgrade minions in order to level up. I did have to uninstall because of the high storage because of the new update. Please make the storage less!!!! Also wouldn't allow new update!!!!"", ""Game has been great but lately, every time I open the app it's been acting like I just installed it(ie starting me at the tutorial then restoring the data). On top of that, when that started happening, when I go into a level, the menu is gone(the pause button, progress meter and banana count hasn't been showing up). Please look into and fix this."", ""This was one of the best games in the past, but ever since the new anniversary update it has been the worst. All my progress was converted into coins which is not enough to repurchase a similar process again. All the costumes I owned I need to upgrade again, start over. I use to love it, now I hate it. Not worth playing because you are going to wake up one day and they will take all your progress and and dump it with an upgrade and you'll have to start all over. Really sucks! Don't waste your time!!!"", ""I LOVE this game. Minions is one of the very best. There is a couple of things I'd like to see change because not everyone is good at near misses. Provide the option to select another challenge if you fail, keep failing the current challenge. Also. developers, PLEASE OPEN other Minions for Rocket and the Moon. I had nearly every Minion in the previous version so a little frustrating to never get the cards to get Minions for additional rocket and moon. Regardeless, this app is LOTS of daily fun."", ""I have been playing this game on and off for it's 5 year run. Seeing this new update and other reviews about the update I have to agree that it is horrible. The whole point of the game was the unlimited times you could run. It wasn't so mission heavy. It was just simple fun. Also, nothing saved from previous game play. Very disappointing. Not a game I'll continue playing."", ""I used to love this game. Until the whole level thing showed up. It really gets annoying and I actually have to go to a level and try not to complete the objective of it so it could become an endless run sort of thing. If you guys could not be that lazy and add back the endless run thing as like a feature I would give it a better rate. For now it's a 2 star."", ""After having upgraded a lot of my costumes to almost the full level I feel cheated that I have to start over. Yes I can collect bananas to upgrade them to where they were, but it would be a lot easier if I didn't lose all my bananas. And the bananas now take a lot longer to collect. After playing this game a lot of hours to get what I had I feel cheated. It should definitely be called 5 year rip off. The money I spent to get what I had was definitely wasted."", 'So far it is a big step back from the original. Explainations as to how things have changed are fragmented, but it looks like not enough thought was put into maintaining progress from the previous version. I have never purchased upgrades from the game, but if I had I would certainly consider participating in a class action law suit...it is that bad.', ""Horrible!! why don't you bring back the very first version of the game, the one where you go against other people's high scores, where you can grow your despicable multiplier to get higher scores, where you had to do despicable missions in order to get higher score multiplier. That was the whole point of the game, what you've done with it is truly despicable (ironically)."", 'its a really fun game but i think its a little too hard to get to the next level even if your good at it you cant pass without a certain number and all you want to do is get to the next level but you cant. But other that its really fun to play and you can pick from really cute minions. But on some of them it does not make sense about the outfits because i never saw them in the movie so what?? It makes NO sense what so ever especially the cookie delivivery girl whos evil i just dont get it???????', ""I used to be so addicted to this game as a kid, now it's just bad. I dont like all the new stuff they put in like character tokens and being able to upgrade them. Also all the missions I liked it better when it was more like sonic dash, you know the bosses and some powerups. It was endless and it was a lot more simple back then. Also being able to just buy characters with bananas or gru coins. Bring back the old version."", ""After spending years working toward certain goals, all progress is gone. The only thing that remains is tokens. The costumes have changed their benefits, and I have to buy them back with bananas I don't have anymore? The power-ups are back to zero level, which seems like pure theft of what we've spent or earned over the years. I understand that I am 'previewing' the new update before the official launch. Please take this update back into your lab and fix these issues before rolling it our permanently."", ""They ruined it. The game used to be an endless runner instantly. You'd download the game and get right into playing the endless runner. Y'know the thing the game advertises itself as, but it's not anymore. It's short, crappy, the controls have a slight delay which is awful for this type of game, and overall it's just not as fun anymore because they removed the endless part of it. You now complete short missions while characters interrupt every two seconds."", 'I loved this game then you updated it and I lost all my progress and it kept saying I would get it back but never did which is really upsetting because I was really far also I hate how we now can only run 5 times and have to wait for more tickets. One of the reasoned I loved this game was because you could play for however long you wanted without having to wait for some type of energy to charge back up. I do like how we can get different costumes and minions without having to buy them that is one good thing about the update.', ""The new update still has A LOT of bugs. I log in every day but only get the log in bonus every few days. There is a free prize pod available every 4 hours. Mine doesn't recharge every 4 hours. When I come back after 4 hours the timer still says 3:59:00. If I miss a token in the special mission it doesn't come back a few seconds later to let me pick it up again. I just miss out on them completely. I'm forced to use all my free lives automatically. I purchased the permanent shield years ago but it was taken away in the new update. All my upgraded minions are back at square one along with all my once maxed powerups that are now not maxed. If you're not currently playing this game, don't start now."", ""The original was better. I would play it and reccomend it if it were like how it used to be. I didn't play this for more than 5 minutes. The missions end as soon as you complete the objective which is so annoying and now it's just overly complicated. I liked moving forward through the different areas and seeing how long or how fast/far I could run. This game isn't very good anymore. it used to be much better. I hope they see these complaints and bring the old game back."", ""I don't know what happen to the game. It was previously biggy but now it running smooth. I'll give y'all that. But something wrong with purchasing options. I mean I think it's great that I have access to all the costumes but the banna I collect doesn't even register. What the point of doing that if I have to earn in a prize pod? Good game, just need some improvements. Good graphics smoother gamplay. Great Idea with each suit having it's own power up specialty. But....I can be running for longer than a minute or rather I don't want to if the bannas I collect doesn't register. Maybe make the banna more rare or something? Idk but that needs to be fixed"", ""This game is fun and addictive, the ONLY game app I have never uninstalled! I love the graphics, so colorful and HD quality! This is by far the funnest game I've ever played, and will keep! I'm glad you keep putting new and interesting scenarios to play, makes it loads of fun! There is one complaint, I hate when it tells me that the video was interrupted, and I SAW the complete video all the way through, so you don't give me my extra life, points etc."", 'Awful. the graphics are amazing, but the gameplay isn\'t. Everytime I ""finish"" by bumping into something, it says ""mission completed"" and locks up the game. There is no way to replay the mission, start over, or move forward at all. Just a blue screen with gold coins and the completed mission. If I complete I should be able to move on...instead I have to completely restart the game, which loses all progress and starts you from the beginning. Should not happen on Galaxy S9 !!!', ""This game used to be awesome. The latest upgrade ruined the game. The graphics are flat & the UI is confusing. They've taken away all the costumes & upgrades that I've earned and purchased. I had over 7 million bananas & now I have 7 thousand! My free-revive costumes are gone, my golden shield is gone, my hundreds of upgrades are all gone! I have spent years building up my supplies of costumes, upgrades, & power-ups!

One issue: The events are very unrealistic. I like events that go well with the event theme, not have a character fighting characters. If the events could be better with the theme, that would be amazing. ❤', ""I love this game. I have so much nostalgia for it. It seems now though, it's entirely too pay to win. There's no fair way to make it through events without buying their new bundles. The character prices just seem like a literal child sat down and typed too many 0's. I know games have to have some revenue from microtransactions to stay afloat, but this is a bit too far. The creators deserve support and all but a fun game is a fair game, not one you have to pay your way through."", 'The ads are inappropriate for the intended audience. Many ads feature a character cheating on their partner (including underwear thrown about) resulting in their partner getting a makeover to make themselves ""more desirable again."" Additionally, we need a way to easily recover progress and purchases. We need to be able to customize names and avatars. At least give us a few options to choose from. The characters are WAY too expensive. Fun game, but please fix these issues.', ""I played this game when I was much younger and coming back to it is such a nostalgia trip. The old mechanics I loved or still there, plus new nonsense and new characters! It's been so long, but I feel like I've come back home. Though, I would like to complain that the first level thingy for the multiplier for the minigames is no longer free, tehehehe."", ""I love this game, it hold up over many years and is just like how it was when i was a kid, the animations are a little rought but thats fine, it takes a bit to get some money but most of the games are set up were if you dont have the money you can watch a add which is better than most mobile games, my only issue is you can't transfer it to a different phone so youd lose all your progress and money spent if you change phones but other than that, great game :)"", ""I used to really like this game, but recently I've been disappointed with it. My main issue is with the character tokens. I've recently noticed that you lose them whenever the character goes on sale, which means you have to start collecting them all over. They're really hard to earn and the amount you have to collect is ridicluous. I had at least 36/50 for Fleur Dis Lee and now I only have 4/50. Please do something about this."", ""I would give it five stars but since I lost all my progress and no matter what, even finishing the tutorial I should've been able to recover it but no. The game refuses and now I have to start from square one. This game seriously needs to have a option to bind account to save progress so it isn't lost forever. Then I'll add five stars"", ""I remember this game being mostly great a few years ago, But returning to it this game has gotten a lot worse. It starts all good, Nothing is unfair and ads arent yet enforced when playing the first few levels, Yet once you progress to a certain point a lot of things are absurdly overpriced. Can't afford something for a quest? Prepare to watch 7 ads because getting the bits for it takes days if not weeks. And playing the mini-games is even worse. Ads can also crash the game sometimes."", ""Yes the app alone is adorable and very cute, the game does not crash and is actually very good. But it's the data retrieval is what is the issue. Say you get a new phone, tablet, etc you cant transfer your previous progress which leads you to losing a lot, it can even get frustrated on some terms. This data transfer and/or retrieval is very irritating in a sense but other than that the game is very great. Have fun playing!"", ""This is one of the best games I've found in the app store. There is always something to do and many places to go. Both me and my daughter play it. I do have a few critiques though: I don't think clearing items or playing games with the characters to build stars should go up in price. The characters and shops themselves are hard enough to afford, and more than half the time I can't load any advertisements to get it done either. I think it should at least be easier to make more bits and gems if everything is going to get crazy expensive. I also think it's a little too geared on real money as well. You can still play the game well enough without purchasing things, but the advertisements for it pop up in your face all the time. And from time to time it freezes my whole tablet, but once I restart it, it's fine. Apart from that though, I recommend it, it's a pretty enjoyable little game. I haven't gotten bored of it like other games."", ""One of the biggest issues I have with this game is the Crystal Mine. I don't know if it's just my game or what, but it lags, barrels spawn in places where its impossible to jump them without falling through a hole or hitting something else, you have to hit a specific spot in order for it to register as jumping on the obstacles instead of hitting them head on, and, most infuriatingly, there are times when I click to jump, and the character jerks once and DOESN'T JUMP."", 'I quite love this game. Very interactive, and can keep you playing several times a day and hour at a time. Quests become increasingly difficult as you progress, and that\'s to be expected in any game, making this a wonderful experience. However, it would be wonderful if you could re-add the ""play across devices"" feature, as some people have to get new devices, or factory reset their phones (as I did) and it\'s very frustrating to have to restart every time. Nearly five stars.', ""I love this game so much! The only issues I have with it are one, when you do the telescope or ball bounce minigames, the timer keeps going while you're moving on to the next picture or when you drop the ball; and two, I feel that the amount of bits required to play some minigames (such as the apple picking minigame) is a little ridiculous. I think it should be a bit cheaper for the lowest exp modifier. I don't want to waste all the bits that I'm saving up for shops on leveling up a pony."", 'I used to play this all the time when I was a child. I stopped playing a while ago, but as I came back the app was very different! The game is still very addictive and I still love collecting the ponies. The new minigames are super fun and you can travel to more lands. The way you can assign a task to a pony is Cool! Even though some tasks take a long time. You can even get gems easier and ponies more easier! But, would it be possible if you can save data / transfer it to another device? Thx!', ""I really loved playing the game: the town building was very well balanced in terms of wait times and premium currency. The game was easy to understand and get into and the social component was well managed. BIG PROBLEM, THOUGH, was that my device broke and when I installed this game on a new one, I had to restart from level 1. That's garbage, since I spent over $100 USD on the game. Since this game takes real-world money, there needs to be a way to recover. (Disclaimer: this was two years ago.)"", ""I'm really disappointed to see the exact reason I quit playing this game years ago is still an issue. It's definitely going to keep me from making in app purchases so I don't end up losing it all over again. Last time I played my town ended up completely overrun by parasprites I couldn't get rid of, and clearable objects kept popping up. Seems like the more I play the more they show up. Other than that the game is pretty fun, it advances quickly so you have plenty of options to drive the story"", ""So things that I've noticed while playing this game. One a lot of adds pop up but it always told me that my internet is to low to watch them even though my internet has been working perfectly fine. Second the game has been none stop crashing I only thought it would happen once but then it became repetitive. I mean the game is cute and fun and all but these two things have been really bothersome."", ""I used to love this game, it was the only thing I spent my free time on. I got a new phone and lost my progress but I knew that would happen so I didnt flip out. I recently downloaded it again and there are sooo many bugs. When I close the game at night or anytime during the day, and reopen it, I go back like 5 levels. That needs to be fixed. Also, why is it 5,000 bits to play with my ponies!? that's outrageous especially since they didnt make it any easier to make the bits. please fix asap."", 'TL;DR: It\'s the only unique G4 MLP pony game there is with a bit of fun gameplay, but it has gambling mechanics. Customer support was 5★. As unfortunate as it is, my previous save of 3+years was completely overwritten after re-installing. I finally called it quits here. The mini-games were alright. Didn\'t personally like the minecart. Characters looked cute, but a number were locked behind unlikely odds, whether it was very time-constrained events, gambling (balloons), or ""leaderboards"" on other events. Even when on sale, cost for some other characters were far too much, which would either pressure you to pay up, or spend a lot of time on it to get them. To give you an idea, I spent at least two solid years of playing often daily, and I still couldn\'t afford all of them when they went on sale. Only recently did they partially allivate this issue, but it\'s still a steep hill to climb. I\'ve enjoyed some of the time I spent on the game, and it\'s taught me much about how a mobile game\'s formula works. But to say it\'s worth picking up would be a lie. If there\'s more forgiving special event timers, skill-based social events rather than ""pay more to get extra tries"", and some more in-universe games that make sense, then I might recommend it.', ""I really LOVED this game for a quite some time. Even to the point where I spent money on it! But recently it has been glitching like crazy. Recently I haven't been able to play the game at all unless I'm on airplane mode because every time I'm connected to internet, the game freezes and crashes. Which would be fine but I'm not making any progress anymore? It seems it takes triple the time to make any progress because my timers on quests and totems constantly reset. Idk what to do. :c"", ""A silly and fun BIG game where you can collect characters and build towns. There's a lot of little games you can play in a ridiculous amount of characters, as well as hundreds of buildings if not thousands. It's enjoyable and the developers constantly update the game with more content. Ads aren't really a problem as you don't have to watch them, and there are opportunities to buy things but everything can be got without spending money. There are limited time events every week to keep it fresh."", ""I love this game dearly, and I've been playing it on and off since I was little, and I've decided to redownload it recently. I was going through the tutorial, and there's a game stopping bug when you get to fluttershy, and you try to collect the reward for her. The arrow directing you is broken! I'll change from 1 star to 5 fives when this is fixed! Edit: the Game was fixed! Thank you for this game so much!!!"", ""The game is fun and I like how it keeps up with the show. The only thing is that the game can be glitchy, I'm not sure if it is connection or what. For example, the Crystal Mine is the worst with glitches, my pony in the cart will randomly fall through the ground when there is no hole to jump over. Another is the shield doesn't always work against barrels or dogs. The Equestria Girls mini game will sometimes lag and cause me to miss notes. But for the most part the game is fun and cute, the pony models have gotten better. And Gameloft Customer Care didn't take forever to respond when I had issues with missing gems, they fixed the problem within a day's time. But this is my second account, my first was lost when I got a new phone. I'm still not happy about that, since it was time and money I put into my first account that I won't be getting back. There is no way to connect my account to Google play for back up. I would like it if Gameloft would fix that, so there won't be any more lost accounts."", ""I would LOVE to give this game 5 stars. I have come and gone from this game many different times due to new devicrs. And I understand the whole losing game data when the app is uninstalled or new device. However, today I was playing with my friends kid and I closed out of the app for 5 minutes to take a phone call and when I loaded it back up for them to play again it had restarted at the very begining! This is ridiculous I didn't uninstall I didn't even clear the cache and the whole game file was lost. This game needs some sort of back up file for it because had I have spent actual cash on this game we would be having a completely different conversation. The amount of cash you're wanting for a bunch of these ponies and gems and stuff is expensive it would run me outta house and car if I spent money like that just for this game to reset itself and I lose all progress. You don't have to have it saved to Facebook, and you have to have it tied to an email to even download the game put in a save feature to save the game to the email. I'll be honest I'm not sure if it resets itself again if I will even keep the game on my device. Please fix this and make some things easier to unlock with gems and stuff and I would change how I felt about this game."", ""I love this game! When it lags because of data being low so could hurt your games. If, you are not on the game every few hours dont really look to get ur extra games completed. If, you start paying it does get expensive. It does teach kids to save up for things to purchase. However it could be a little easier to get rubies, or lessen the cost of things. Im at 107 and have spent hundreds and still don't have half of the things you can buy with the rubies."", 'Great graphics, but there\'s WAY too many ads and the ""friend just beat your highscore!!!"" message is annoying as heck. I don\'t care. Cool. Good for them. Also in the crystal mine mini game, sometimes I\'ll tap the screen to jump and it will make the jumping sound affect, but my character won\'t jump, causing me to crash. Sometimes I\'ll just fall through the tracks. Not fall into one of the gaps, just fall through. Also the equestria girls game is really laggy sometimes.', ""The game is really fun and I keep wanting to proceed. However, there's sometimes been glitches that make it impossible for points. In the Crystal Mine mini-game, a glitch made the screen stop and the kart hit a barrel. Just now, in the Telescope game, the line didn't appear when I played. I tried to get off the app. But the game time continued. Even when I tried to put my phone to sleep!"", 'Ive been playing this game since i was little. I redownloaded it a few weeks ago. But there has been this bug going on whenever i get on the minecart game. Whenever I try to play it, it kicks me off the app. The mini game worked well for a lot of levels but on level 41, it just kept kicking me off the app. Is there anyway you could fix this please? Otherwise, its a really great game.', 'This game is clearly more about spending real money than enjoying it. The quests require you to spend massive quantities of gems in order to progress and there is hardly anything to do without spending. My daughter enjoys the mini games like dancing and playing in the mine but the point of the game is to collect the MLP characters and enjoy playing with them. These new side quests are more of a distraction that makes it difficult for her to know what to do.', ""The game itself is really fun, and the controls are easy. Unfortunately, it didn't save my progress which upsets me, because I was pretty far in the game and had some characters you can only win from events. UPDATE. Newst problem is when I redownload the game, it stops instailling MB at the gamw menu at less then half way."", 'Would be better if there was a ""are you sure you want to purchase this?"" Option. I cannot tell you how many times I\'ve saved up bits/gems, only for me to accidentally click on an item I didn\'t wanna buy (using gems to skip tasks, accidentally pressing the 40000 bits instead of the ""watch ad"" option for a minigame) I might actually stop playing cause I\'m getting so upset over losing all the bits I\'ve spent time saving up. But you\'re not reading so what does it matter? 😐', 'I LOVED playing this game and had spent so much time on it. I even spent a little real money for a couple of the events. Well I encountered a few major issues in the game and had to uninstall and then reinstall the game...and I lost EVERYTHING. I was back to lv 1 with NOTHING. I summited a ticket for help and immediately got a generic reply back for more info. I followed the directions and NEVER heard from them again. It has been over 4 months. Getting your account back should be easy!', 'I\'ve had this game several times over the last 8 yrs. I usually end up deleting it because of storage issues. But now, I have a real complaint. When the video button lights up to watch a video, it doesnt work. That\'s the only way to make any actual progress without paying. After clicking the ""watch video"" button, it says ""oops. Something is wrong with this feature."" Please fix this issue. No point in playing if I cant make any headway. 3 stars because of the messed up feature. 5 if fixed.', ""The game is great. Love it. However, I have many complaints about the time bonus quests. Namely, the Changeling Kingdom fight against Chrysalis. The time bonuses should make you want to play more, not stress out to the point you feel obligated to delete the app to start over. The bonuses do not account for time that people sleep. I have checked in constantly, sometimes even staying up until 3am just to collect to crystals in order to achieve the bonuses, however that strategy still doesn't work"", ""I have been playing since 2015 and I still LOVE this game. It's not that childish, and it is very addicting, even for teenagers. My favorite part may be the minigames, especially the Equestria Girls one. I do not like the limited-time story events because whenever one happens, when you log on, it goes through a giant string of unskippable dialogue. This is the game that made me like MLP to a certain extent, and I still love it to this day."", 'I love the game, but its such a slow working game. I had to delete the app sadly, because the game would take up too much space, lag from time to time, and how slow it moves. Plus, when I drag the screen, (screen drag) it drags slowly. Still, the game is lovely, kids of all ages can play this game. Enjoy it!', ""I like this game, but I think that the amount of time it takes for some tasks and how long it takes to accumulate money is a bit much. I think the looks/animation of the ponies can be improved and I wish that the outfits were more accurate. think there is a glitch in the gem mine because half the time I can't double jump when I come across where the track is broken in multiple places so when I jump I just fall straight through one of the broken tracks."", ""The only things I find wrong with the app are one all the ponies and items that are discounted along with one item and several Jems pop up too frequently and in the middle of the mini games. The second is sometimes the screen feels way too cluttered with all the discounted ponies, the map, and so on. Other then those 2 things it's a really good game that I do enjoy playing."", ""It's awesome! Nothing wrong with the game and controls are workable. But one time it let me keep on getting the balloon pop over and over again and the next day I lost all my progress since the glitch. Can u pls fix this so no one else will experience it. I also like how u can find an upside down box with derpy hooves (muffins) in it and can earn even gems by finding and clicking it. Funny thing to mention, if u zoom close to the worker pony, it looks like his pouch of tools is a part of him XD"", ""I LOVED this game at first, and still sometimes play. But soon you'll come to realize that *everything* is way. too. expensive. Premium currency is hard to come by, expensive, and doesn't go far before you're broke, again. The devs are NOT kind to their players. Finishing new events is only accessible to pay-to-players; it's a great game until you run out of you initial currency and story-based rewards; bad longevity-- bad news for a collecting-type game.

It's a solid 3rd person ww2 shooter, there's a pretty great cover system which is cool, most mobile games don't have any sort of cover system. The game also seems playable offline which is awesome. The campaign is okay, the levels are super linear which is kinda boring but at least you'll never get lost or confused which is good for a mobile game. Overall, I'd recommend it! It's really great for a mobile game!"", ""Campaign/story mode is fun and worth the game. Multiplayer ruins it. It's just constant spawn camping. You literally respawn for a few seconds and you're dead, over and over. Fix multiplayer with random spawn points, like every other multilayer game, and you'll get a better rating. Like, is it really that hard to put in the extra effort to change this when all your other reviews are complaining about the same thing?"", 'Awesome! Only issue I have is that the hired hand use button is right next to the pause button. Both are in the upper right part of the screen and 75 percent of the time when I use the hired hand button I end up pausing the game. Recommend spacing these buttons a little farther apart. Other than that game is awesome. Love the aim assist!', ""The graphics are great, just wish it had an aim button to help aim better. The multiplayer game kind of sucks when you play against people that's ranked way higher than you. Also my team had two people and the other had three which was spawning us right in the middle of the gunfire not giving us a chance to move or hunt for the other members and just get killed every time. Points and upgrades to weapons could be better."", ""It's ok, the games graphics, design, sound, controls, and a bit mire stuff is ok too, but the games store is just way to expensive, and its realy hard to get medals, and the energy is just such a pain in the rear end. Overall, it's a decent game, if you would just fix these problems, it would be the perfect game."", 'A very fun campaign experience! (Haven\'t tried multiplayer yet) Wide variety of weapons, missions, enemies, and well-planned tactical situations to work out in gameplay. Took me some effort to get the hang of it - small, subtle adjustments to your aim are key, along with controlled bursts of gunfire and use of ""consumable"" weapons (grenades, Molotov cocktails, bazookas, etc.) My fave WWII (love the history!) shooter for mobile!', 'Controls are not modern, and are clunky. Online spawns are completely broken, to the point where i was spawn killed after 1 second every single time for an entire match. The graphics are OK. The game has so many game breaking micro transactions that you cannot play without paying. Just no.', ""Good app with decent controls. However, I don't understand how the most recent installent to the Brothers in Arms Franchise happens to be an app. Works well with a gamepad, unfortunately I cannot seem to get the left trigger to work properly. It works fine with other apps there may be an issue with this one."", ""it's a good game, though. when you reached level 7, you need to buy guns that needs real money. also the PVP mode, it's not good. player shoot you as you get back from the game because they were waiting at the spot where they knew you will come. not fair and very frustrating."", ""Just installed purchased starter pack and got charged and never received the bundle. I got to play 2 campaign missions, made purchase than figured I'd restart app since I didn't receive items. Now the app loads and 10 seconds later forces closed and I get a report the game had a bug that needs to be fixed, to update after development fix bug. I just want a refund for my purchase. I've sent 2 emails regarding my refund. I'll dispute purchase if I must"", ""It's a fun app so far. Does seem to be pushing essential items that must be purchased in order to complete tasks though. Graphics are great, control systems easy to use. Great game, much better than Warcraft or Kiss of War."", ""I have played the almost the third time now but I have several problems with it. 1. You can enter the battle field with more than 1 gun. 2. You can't use the consumables obtained during the scavenge the supplies missions. It's boring"", ""Ok I'm getting pissed at the controls and there's a time where you will hear voice actor saying to you what you have todo but sometimes no voice just letters and i hate it cus you can't ride any vehicles nice graphics tho and i hate the fact that we just 2 soldiers fighting 9836 soldiers and like i said the controls are hard even when I turn the better performance nothing change and add a chapter 10 and there's energy i want to play long but 1 energy is 15 frickin minutes what the hell is this?"", ""It's amazing game with wicked story line....graphics r cool.....I would of gave 5 star if they give u more points so u can upgrade and buy grenade....they made it impossible to get anything with so little points after cleaeing a stage...terrible....I guess they want u to spent money and buy...that's not cool"", 'I give 5 star depend on my early experience. But 2 star for now. The game is awesome in story mode. Full of enjoyable. But in online event it’s just lol.😆 The haker ruin the game. By the way I want more chapter. I finished 9th chapter. Now its time to uninstall the game, If you don’t increase the chapter.', ""This use to be the best game I have ever played on android phone, until I changed my phone and can't download it or neither work when I transfer from my old devic, please you have to work on it, even with strong WiFi connection it doesn't work"", 'Would have given 5 stars but medals are needed for alot things and are very hard to get, unless you purchase there is no way of getting them offline. Its really painful I wish this can be worked on. Otherwise nice storyline and all. Great work', ""This game is good it's 9 to 10...the storyline is really good,the cutscenes are well done,the action,guns n easy way to earn dog tags...the african campaign is gud... this is one of the best offline shooting games,it makes u wanna play more,it has the call of duty vibe type...u shud make a BIA4....all I can say is this game is amazing... thanks gameloft"", ""They want you to upgrade weapon after every stage but they don't provide you money for that. Overall you have to play mission again and again and again if you want to move forward in the game."", 'Splendid, just Splendid. Please keep up the good work and also, please make it a bit easier to get cash or coins to purchase items. It currently too hard and can end up discouraging people from continuing the game.', 'The new update is having problems with my controller 😔 I cant aim or shoot no more I tried it with my other games and it works fine... but overall is a great game one of the only ones out there with an awesome campaign mode', ""I love this game so far and would have rated more but: 1: I at a point had 20 stars and wanting to buy consumables was told my account is being used on another device. ( this was the first day playing the game and first time downloading the game) so who else would be using a new account?. 2: I logged in today to find out 20 stars have become 2😣 and I'm playing and gaining stars but it's not adding up with the ones I have and hence I cannot buy any consumables so I'm stuck with the guns I have"", 'Quite an engaging game. The story line and illustrations are compelling. I only wished all the features could be assessed offline. Overall, a game worthy to have on any phone', ""It's a nice game , perfect graphics.. offline game and easy movement.. Just need to make weapons a little bit easier to find."", ""It's a nice game,have being enjoying playing it, though they are some parts keep repeating,some guns don't have that power to kill an enemy with two shorts ,you can not be a sniper and you make two shorts ,any sniper kills with one short only ,should work on that"", ""At first everything was going fine with the game for a very long time,then I switched on my data one day and tap the game to open then it's says I should update the game , after updating the game it now I should download the file .the problem now is that the game file is not able to complete the download despite the fact that I have data on my sim.i don't know what to do about it."", 'Absolutely an incredible game especially now you can play offline on normal game levels. But still need to change the multiple player to carrier data not WiFi', ""The best action packed shooting game on the planet 😬🙂.. I think though. I've installed this game on three of my consecutive phones and I don't get tired or bored of it. Everything is almost perfect with this game.. 🥂"", 'This game is 100% real, the graphics is the very best and creative, everything about this game spectacular...trust me, if you\'ve not downloaded this game, then you\'ve not experienced the authenticity of a real game put together by a dynamic team. ""Just press install"" 🏆🏅🥇', 'I played this game far back on symbian phones and since then I have been looking for the android version until now. I am rating brothers in arms ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ rating because of the symbian version. I hope it is as good or better than the symbian version of those old days of symbian 🌎 of technology. This game inspired me to 🤔 of a game developer. When done checking, i will come back for the proper review.', ""I played this game and it's too hard to farm the points and dog tags and medals ... Which I did and finally bought the experimental gun I don't remember the name but now I just installed this game with the same Gmail account but it's starting a new ... Stupid game can't even keep the data safe"", ""The game is cool and I love it I could have rate the game with 5 stars 🌟 but I don't understand why the consumables picked up in the the game can't be kept permanently for the brothers I mean for it to be used in any mission and any time you want to use it Now am supposed to buy a sniper and continue the game from chapter 4 going but the kind of sniper they want me to buy is give to me to buy It was said that I should play chapter 4 raid 1 before the weapon is given to me to buy I've played it"", 'Honestly love the game. But my only challenge is it takes time for you to get bonus and have to upgrade. And yet purchase weapons.', ""This is a nice game and with good graphics, my only problem is that it's nearly impossible to get medal coins in this game that makes it difficult to buy weapon's and for that it's frustrating"", 'I love the action and everything about this game. I wish we can play the multipayer mission with out mobile data instead of connecting to wifi.

Update 13 is out now!<br><br>WHAT’S NEW? <br><br>- NEW ARMOR SETS: Add the Knightly Thistle set and Ruthenian set to your armory! <br>- Minor improvements and bug fixes","[""It was a little different from other games I've played in the sense that you can't freely run around but once I got used to that and realized that this game is simply focused on fighting, and more fighting then I found I REALLY like it!! A lot of games will leave you in a plateau and you really can't go further quickly or reasonably without buying some upgrades but I haven't spent t a dollar and get hours of fighting and upgrading each day.. I gave you a 4.. good game!"", ""I love the graphics, and story line. The combat graphics are superb. The only problem I have with this game is the inability to control the player. You can't explore, not move the player at all, so your just tapping the same button constantly and the combat is automatic. If you had control like in dungeon hunter, this game would be the best."", 'Like the game, but it has a lot of problems, battle controls, very difficult to select opponent by swiping or tapping. Special attacks are unresponsive can take between 3-15 seconds to execute. You can watch 30 second ads to get gems but the ads are already so thick that when ever I change screens I get stuck with an ad for 5 or 15 seconds. This game gets a lot of glitches, they fix them but it takes a while and then you just get another. Seems to be a lot of updates to install', ""Awesome graphics and gameplay with a good story line. I've only been playing a day and I love it. The only thing is is that you can't run around yourself but the fighting and blocking in the game give you a pretty good range of combos you can do mixed in with your other weapons and powers. Overall a great game. Kind of difficult at first figuring ot all out as far as outside the storyline goes"", 'I was expecting more from a gameloft game. This game feels clunky and slow using manual controls, so it almost feels like if you are not using auto combat, you are not going to succeed. The graphics are good, and the storyline is skippable, which is nice, but the combat feels like you tried to reinvent the wheel, but came up with a square that doesn\'t roll well. This title cannot compete in this market when you have games like, ""Darkness Rises"" that do the same thing, but much more smoothly.', ""Great game I really like it! The visuals are incredible and the upgrade system checks out. It's a grind but at least with this game it seems worth it and it's not really a pay to play experience! I'm giving it 4 stars for 1 and only 1 VERY important reason, the ALLIANCE feature is BROKEN, when you click on it it's just sits on a loading screen forever and after 30-40 minutes of waiting inevitably you have to just swipe out of the game. PLEASE PLEASE FIX!! Other than that the game is great fr!"", ""not at all a bad game. the graphics are amazing. combat is okay but I wish if you tap on a distant enemy it would do an attack but 30 min in that's not an option. once in a mission It has 3 or 4 stages and they're separated by black screens so that's another negative and why It doesn't get 5 stars but overall definitely a solid game on a mobile device!"", 'Great and not so great. Game play is awesome. Plenty of opportunity to level without paying to play. Allows for team play without relying on it to enjoy the game. Downside is the latest bug fix has created several login issues. Not sure what has happened but in order to log in I have to uninstall and reinstall, too much of a hastle. Deleting.', 'Graphics are excellent, story is interesting. The controls limit you to only move the camera, not your character. Its basically on rails. There is no exploration or freedon to run around the world whatsoever. Small groups of enemies will apear and you, like an Amtrak train, will head right for them. Combat is relatively easy to use if not kindy boring. WORST PART, Every 15 seconds a black screen abruptly appears as it loads the next set of enemies to throw you at. very disengaging.', ""I really enjoy medieval games so I downloaded this game, I have enjoyed playing this and I think it is really fun. One thing I dont like about it is that the character automatically moves so you can't control were you go, which makes it hard to roleplay. I also dont like the auto fight function because it basicly makes it to were you can only use the ability buttons, however this is automatically turned off and is your option to use it. Another thing was that so.etimes when I hit the block button it didn't work but that is to be expected of any mobile game."", ""Now, I dont usually give 5 stars, but this game is one of the MOST enjoyable that i've played. Do I think it could have been a little more polished? absolutely. but other than that this game has one of the most satisfying and rewarding loot systems of all games that I have tried. the gear is so addicting to collect and strive for, I have had no problem sinking hours into this game. The combat is exhilarating (decapitations especially) and the flow of combat is smooth as butter. great work guys!!"", ""This game is very repetitive. VERY! Short storyline (although it's a decent one). Not many choices of character. Buttons will jump around the screen. It's not pay2play, the ones claiming it is are just horrible at these types of games. You'll have to grind day in and day out but you definitely don't have to pay. The description also states that the game has IN-APP PURCHASES (also for those who can't read)."", ""Great graphics. Legit story and voice overs. The gameplay was really boring tho. Mostly a game about stacking the right item types to beat levels with enemy's of other types. Constantly using block to counter enemies looks trashy and is about the only challenge to the game. Got bored so fast which is sad because this game took forever on the DL and looks incredible. It's all autopath with 3 sets of enemies per level. Visually epic for a mobile tho."", ""On the one hand, the graphics are downright gorgeous, and I like that you actually wear the armor, not just put it on and the character looks exactly the same. The play is certainly smooth and enjoyable to watch. Unfortunately, I'm not playing games to just watch what happens on screen, I'm paying games to be engaged, and this game suffers from a complete lack thereof, as you'll spend most if not all of your time in auto combat, as there's really no complexity or strategy to combat to begin with but strike and block. I would hardly call this a game of any sort. My biggest issue with the game that I haven't bothered to get involved in is the paid portion. This is consistent across mobile games, that you're sure to be charged positively absurd amounts of your livelihood for absolutely minor product. I wouldn't even call it product, cause it certainly won't last. $100 for 50k gold when I made 20k in a few hours? Even if it took me longer, ARK survival evolved is on sale for $20 right now, and never have to pay another dime, and THAT is a REAL game. This is just pretty. I was gonna rate it two stars because it was pretty, but the ridiculousness of the fees just won't let it get away with that."", 'Love it! This game is worth it, it keeps the battle going and keeps you on your toes! You run into action automatically so all you have to do is keep your gear and weapons strong and mix up your attacks. Voice acting is good, graphics are good, all around feel and story mode is great! Good job guys!!', ""Dang, what a good game. The combat is similar to The Witcher series, or the Batman Arkham games. It's reaction based combat. You don't actually control your characters movements, but the combat is so fluid you still feel satisfied. That being said, the game throws fun at you in the beginning, but underneath it will hit you with a paywall. It's pay to win. Simple as thar. It's a gorgeous game that makes you dip into the wallet to advance."", 'Beautiful, addicting gets deeper than most hack and slash games. But a * for lagginess, causing battles to favor enemy. You eventually catch up, but you\'ve made maneuvers according to the lagging visuals. Another * for the sometimes wild camera, very difficult to decide moves when the enemies back fills 80-90% of screen in fortress battles. And recently I finished a fortress battle (i wasn\'t attacked any more) and ""I"" just stood looking at wall, timer running down, then it registered as a loss.', ""Looks cool and the combat is cool but you can not free run and explore and you can't control your character's movement he just automatically runs to each group of enemies you can swipe towards an enemy to target it but i just don't enjoy not being able to have full capacity to control my character. Disappointing really.. Really was looking forward to checking this game out at work all day total weiner killer"", ""It's good, but can be very monotonous. Expect to grind unless you open your wallet. Also, I'm noticing a strange bug where if you open the store and cancel a transaction, it causes the game's FPS to drop significantly. I'm using a Galaxy S9, which has the specs to run it smoothly (it was smooth before I looked at the store). There are lots of things to do in the game, but they're all relatively the same: Spawn in, press Auto-Fight, press abilities once they're available, do it again."", ""This game is awesome ,playing on GalaxyNote8,Highest settings . And even though I'm still low level and young in the campaign, I've only played 2% of it. But I've farmed/replayed each segment multiple times ,and at this point in time I've only had at tops maybe 6 -10 enemy's on screen at once (like I said about the Campaign&Me).So I have no clue how many at higher levels ,etc..., And So far this game has run nothing but smooothhh ...near NxtGen Console Graphics ,with a solid fps ,(definitely a NxtGen experience for me especially, being that my last 2 phones :note 2 ,iPhone5 both OldAF, i haven't tried ,so have no clue, but I doubt either could run this game) like always a Gameloft dev team have created a beautiful game , Great Story...so far It's been easy to learn how to play ,very intuitive controls, the time it takes for your finger to push an action on device screen and for your character to act it out in game ,it's almost instantaneous, very fast and responsive almost fluid like movement/transitioning from enemy to enemy while using all your powers and weapons at the same time, while blocking, and this game has never once lagged or became unresponsive ,or crashed .So....so far I'mloving it, but we shall see ...2BeContinued...later as I progress further in the game"", ""So the game seemed fun until I unlocked the fortress. The game forces you to do the tutorial, but everytime you try to attack it says attack failed. There's no way to back out or continue playing. You HAVE to complete a fight in order to continue playing and it's apparently broken. I've used over 100 energy over the last week, having to wait until it refreshes to try more problem solving. I have done everything I could. It's a shame because I was really enjoying this game that is now broken."", 'Atfer waiting almost 30 minutes to download over a gig of data, I was unable to move my own character. Not because of issues but because that is the games design. Having zero control over character movement or enemy to attack this game was simply hit attack or defend for the first 3 levels straight. there was zero challenge. no reason to continue playing. nothing interesting or exciting. I was left feeling like I just wasted an hour of my life.', 'Typical hack and slash. The graphics are very good though, and the overall gameplay is very fun. I would have liked to be able to have a better training mission experience and better understanding of the upgrades earlier in the game though before losing epic equipment to upgrade standard weapons without knowing the difference at the time.', 'You put too much effort into the story and all the little additives that all the ""cool games"" have (i.e. chests, multiplayer, arenas, all the materials required for weapon evolutions, etc.) and not enough effort into the actual game experience. We want a game where you can customize your character, not br forced to be some gay little French boy. We\'re tired of having to use whatever weapon happens to have the best stats. Let us customize our weapons and armor so we can work on upgrading them.', ""It's supposed to take place in France and all the characters have French names, but they mysteriously speak in English accents. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ I don't like not being able to control where my character goes, but the gameplay is smooth and the story is typically trope. There are a bunch of pay to win elements I don't like."", 'I dont usually rate apps / games unless they really amaze me. But for this game i make an exception. To say: ""Wow, Awesome! I like the game"", would be an understatement. The game, is full of nuances, well thought out controls, interfaces, player enhancements, stages, events, etc that sustain player interest but most of all its just fun. Thank you for making such an addictive and enjoyable game.', ""I'm stuck on the fortress tutorial due to a bug where when you go to attack somebody, it immediately gives you a failed attack prompt. I can't progress no matter how many times I quit the game and open it back up again. I love this game and will bump up my rating if you guys could look into this."", 'Got up to level 70, game is fun. Rewards you a lot. I probably got over 5000 rubies just in normal game play, which equals to a $99 pack. Got boring after a while and repetitive. But the biggest issue was completing missions and quests and the system disconnecting from the server and not rewarding you, and by default assigning you a loss. Kind of infuriating when you complete something challenging and on The rewards screen the game just hangs. And after restarting it, you get attributed a loss.', ""alot of fun to play thought it would be a reskin of assassins creed identity but it's not. hard to hit those perfect defense. A training arena would be useful no energy use, no xp gain, no coin, just timing training against unlimited waves of enemy so you can know exactly when to hit the shield button and get perfect defence."", ""Great game. As others have stated, the graphics are most impressive. Problems: Ads appear at the most inopportune time. When I tried to get rubies with ads, it freezes up. Internet connection is peachy. I'm having reservations about playing any longer."", 'DUDEEEEE!!! I LOVE this game! Automatic movement makes for easy focus on main challenges and missions. Graphics and visuals are equally as amazing supporting gameplay, I play for hours and its addicting. Merging shields with swords to upgrade like what? this is a perfect game! thank you!!', 'Looked interesting and visuals were great but the actual gameplay is non existant. No movement control capabilities. Only controls given are attack and block. There is no point in ""playing"" a game if it doesn\'t allow you to play the game yourself.', 'this game has issues and very bad lag when in combat and using your skills in PVP matches. there is delay in skill move sets and when in combat while engaging the combatants. However, this happens also when in events and during game play when trying to complete a mission and trying to complete a task under time frame to get a perfect score of 3 Three Skull rating on a mission.', ""It's designed like an open world mmo, but you cant even freely move; theres no analog to move around. The character moves on its own and you have to respond with attacks. I didnt even finish the first stage and uninstalled it regardless of the graphics. Its boring, not worth the time"", ""It's a beautiful game sure enough. But, I've been stuck on a stage I'm not strong enough to even get into to fight for a week. Because I can't upgrade my equipment. It's getting to where I'm about to uninstall this game to because of limitations. Things it says I can get in certain stages I fight and dont get what I need or I fight and run out of energy trieing to get what I need. Then don't have energy until 5-6 hours later. Great game but the limitations are getting to be not worth playing."", ""Game was okay, pretty enjoyable until I unlocked the fortress. I was unable to do anything else but try to attack another player during the tutorial, and was told attack failed everytime. After using all the tickets available to attack (15) I gave up. I'm uninstalling, I've seen a few others have the same experience, so I would recommend against installing, but that's just me."", 'Boring and HUGE 1.5gb game file??? Basically an attack and block only game with no exploration or free movement. Looks like there are a ton of extras later on in the game but the main story mode is VERY basic block/attack buttons only. The 1.5gb game file??? Probably due to having WAY too many types of currancy/keys and really good graphics with no gameplay... waste of data to download for me .', ""The game is good. The story line, is great. However, there is a slight problem, whenever I finish a stage (if that's what is called it) the rewards don't appear as well and 'continue' button in result of me being stuck on it. I could only restart the game and the level which is waste of energy, I hope you devs fix it. And also a little bit improvement of the graphics is an icing on a cake to make the game much more better."", 'I like the idea of this game and the concept of it. The story line is amazing and the way of upgrading gear is great. However this game would have got five stars from me if there were different types of fighting instead of the whole spam attack, spam attack, spam attack, block, repeat and wave after wave of enemies. It gets very boring very quickly. There needs to be some sort of special game mode or game soft need to change the fighting style so you actually need to use tactics.', ""Overall a good game and worth trying. The controls are for the most part good, but sometimes a bit unresponsive. Sometimes you're able to attack and jump between enemies like someone possessed and sometimes you just stand there like an idiot. The camera sometimes gets positioned behind big enemy units making it difficult to see what's going on. Gathering materials can be very grindy since you have you do the same level about 5 million times to get what you need.""]",False,"['com.gameloft.android.ANMP.Gloft5DHM', 'com.direlight.grimvalor', 'com.nexon.da3.global', 'com.kiloo.stormblades', 'com.hg.takashi.ninjagames']","['com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA9HM', 'com.gameloft.anmp.sniper.champions', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDMHM', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA8HM', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDOHM']",com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftHFHM,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftHFHM&hl=en&gl=us

See below to check out all the latest features coming to DML:<br>- The Spring Divine Fest is here! Joining the ever-growing collection of Divines, it’s time to meet our Irish- and Mayan-inspired spring dragons!<br>- Is it proof of the multiverse or maybe just dragons cosplaying as humans? We don’t know, but our new monthly dragons sure look familiar...&quot;","['I really enjoy this game, they save money on models by ""copying"" the base dragon models and add features that makes them unique which I do enjoy. Though it\'s very time heavy making it where you have to plan out when to play and when not to, exploiting a busy day. Which doing so can be alright but it goes from simple, easy to play to somewhat difficult and time consuming, it\'s not so bad to the point where you don\'t want to play it just gets annoying sometimes. Though I do appreciate the qualitiy', ""Been playing DML on & off for the better part of 5 years. Truly my favourite comfort game, but once you get to a certain point there's not much to do anymore except get weekly/monthly dragons & arena battles. I love it regardless and its something I'll always come back to. As for everyone complaining about ads, I never get unsolicited ads while playing."", ""I'm seriously considering uninstalling unless they introduce a way to get rid of the incessant, random pop up ads. I'd be willing to pay money for this because I adore the game and the ads introduced once you have progressed a bit render it unplayable.  In the game My Singing Monsters, once you make an in-app purchase, they no longer make you watch ads unless you choose to in order to speed something up. Please offer an option like this. Would be a 5 star rating if not for this issue!"", 'during tutorials, there are no ads, but after that it is attack of the ads! you can bareley click the screen without seeing an ad. you can barely do anything in the game without watching an ad. and then, when you choose to watch an ad, it ask you if your sure. on top of all that, they say they are just short videos, but all of them are interactive and they like to hide the close ad button behind the phone go back button also, the game will crash randomly after an ad, forcing you to close it', 'Decent game. But the problem is the ADS. They play frequently, which I can live with, but when they play they are not sized correctly to the screen, so the skip arrows and the X to close is off screen. This makes the game nearly unplayable as you have to force close the game then restart it to continue.', ""Friend Codes in the game do not work. I've tried multiple times trying to add my boyfriend to my friend list, and it says code invalid. I've also been playing on a tablet and once I got my phone, I logged in with Facebook and it did no transfer my data. It does take a lot of time for somethings upgrade but it isn't really bad. Overall, it's a fun and cute game. But, some areas could definitely use some improvement."", ""Ads on this game makes it very unplayable. They can pop up at any time! Even when you're collecting food from the farms (a simple tap). Don't let it fool you with no ads in the begining. It will be loaded with ads that render this game unplayable. Some of the ads, you can't even back out of unless you play the demo.... Devs should take notes of other similar games and just tie ads to rewards only to keep game playble. Needless to say, uninstalled."", ""This game was fun at first, but it's kinda laggy on my phone. It's not like the add I have about it at all though. It said I could take a picture of something and my dragon would turn into that object. But whatever, I kept playing it. Then it asked me for my location! You can't continue playing unless you leak where you live so it can track wherever you live. It's so bad ide rate it a zero. But that's not possible, so I give it a 1. Thanks for reading this please fix the game."", ""Can't get enough of it. Though I am still unable to visit my friends and help them out. It always freezes, I assumed it was phone until it happened everytime. Only other issue I have, is it seems to freeze when I purchase things and have had messed up purchases more than once. THEY ALWAYS MAKES IT RIGHT THOUGH!! NEVER have they screwed me over, they've always given me something for my inconvenience and make note of their lag. Even with the issues I've came across, I plan to keep playing!"", 'Love the game, but you need to work on the annoying ads. I get that it provides revenue to you, but it is frustrating to have the ads pop up out of nowhere literally every 1-2 minutes. Some of them are so persistent that I have to restart the game since they have no option to exit. They also seem to start bogging down the speed of play and control response.', 'I really enjoy this game, but after a few months of playing there have been some issues. The game will occasionally kick me out and I will completely miss out on something, or all of the progress I made ceases to exist. The designs and everything are amazing, though I do think before adding more events and stuff- please take the time to fix these bugs. This would make the game so much better.', ""Love this game! I've been playing it for years and it's one of my favorites. From dragon design, to combat, I love the structure of it. Only 4 out of 5 because no matter what money I spend, I can't get rid of the ads. I get that ads equals revenue, but I'd feel more enticed to spend money in the game if it got rid of the ads."", 'Game is fun with lots of events weekly that makes it worth checking out. However, the micro transactions in the game is ridiculous. An example is their bottomless dungeon event... even when you reach the end, you still are not guaranteed the dragon and have to purchase ""stepping stones"" in order to get the final prize. They should definitely reevaluate how hard they push this.', 'great game. a few issues. i can deal with ads, theyre annoying and it makes it hard to play the game, but i still do. what makes it unplayable, are the ones i simply cannot back out of. those ""the real cost"" ads with the minigame show up within 2 minutes of me entering the game, and im unable to close them out. the game is also slow and a bit laggy, even with my excellent connection. not worth all the trouble', ""Great game, but as of right now there are ads that you cannot exit out of, making it impossible to play after getting the ad. You have to completely exit out of the game and come back, only for the ad to pop back up like 5 minutes later. It's such a shame considering i play this game frequently. Please fix and I'll bump my rate back up to 5 stars"", 'The game concept is fun and the graphics are great. The EXCESSIVE ads make the game almost unplayable. For every 10 minutes of play, there is a forced ad that stops whatever action is being taken. Several of the ads have glitched causing the game to either crash or the ad to play on repeat with no way to stop them. I would not recommend this game to anyone.', ""Love this game! My husband and I originally downloaded it for our son but then we got hooked on it. There's almost an endless amount of dragons to breed and hatch. The only thing I don't like about the game is that in the beginning you start to level up your top three dragons which can take a lot of time and effort to level them up. You end up getting stuck with those three or the ones that get enchanted the most first for all the battles etc, the rest of the game."", 'My previous problem was handled quickly and aside from not enough legendary pieces in the chests this is my favorite game also like the fact no stupid music but the sound of waves, wish you would stop playing the Disney ads as they are inaccesable and lose all ""free"" gifts when they are played. Going to stop spending $$ if I can\'t get my ""free"" stuff', ""This game used to be really fun. But now after the update, I can't exit out of the ads and there is the same ad right when I open the game. I'm trying to save up for the lumino dragon but, again, after the update I can't exit out of the stupid ad that pops up literally 3 seconds after I open the dang game. Please fix this or a lot of people who have the same issue that i'm having will DELETE. Including me..."", ""It was fun, until I got to the metal level, then all of the sudden it would put adds in that I couldn't get out of. They were always doing it when I had a battle or something,, so when I try going back into the game,, it erases.. I was really disappointed, and I think I am going to delete the game because of that."", ""I see alot of negative comments on this game, I have not found the issues they touch on. The adds only come up on certain occasions and mostly when you want something without having to pay for it. I find this fair. The graphics are done well, no lagging or crashing and the mechanics of the game seem to work well and mostly balanced. I do wish they could cut the cost on some items, or make gems more plentiful. Gold is no problem I've currently have 70 mil. Never run out. Lol."", ""A few years ago, I adored this game. Such wonderful gameplay that peaks your expectations, would've recommended over Dragon City. But it had reset my progress one day randomly, even though I had logged in with Facebook, I hadn't deleted the game or anything. 1-2 years later I tried it again, got back up to where I used to be, only for the same thing to happen AGAIN. I might try it out again, but I'm quite scared to after what's happened before, especially because I lost the special dragons."", ""So, I've really enjoyed playing this game for a long time, I love it, and I recently downloaded it again. I've only had it for a few days and suddenly today the game keeps crashing because of a The Real Cost ad. I can't exit out of this ad and even after I play the little demo inside of the ad, it won't go away. I just have to keep closing out the app and opening it again. I can't have the app open for more than a few minutes without it crashing because of this ad. Please fix this if you can!"", ""I'm ok with watching ads to earn extra stuff or to skip time but it's annoying when ads randomly pop up. Half the time there isn't a way to close out of them even when the timer I'd over which causes me to completely have to close out of the game and go back into it. Other than the annoying pop up ads it really is a decent game."", ""As much as I've enjoyed the game. I'm getting ready to trash it. For the none stop adds for just playing the game. I already arch enough for speed boosts. Let alone the random ones being thrown in my face. Not to mention, half the time I watch an ad it crashes the game and forfeits my time boost. Great game play, terrible annoying sea of ads that don't either work, crash the game, or don't give me the rewards they say I'll get. DISAPPOINTED!!"", ""The game is fun, lots to do. But the ads! The ads are so annoying. Sometimes I'm just clicking around, moving things or whatever, and I've clicked an ad that hasnt even popped up yet on my screen, takes like 20 secs to load the play store and all that, I've gotta wait for the opportunity to click the x, sometimes it gives you a 30 sec ad that you cant skip.... now the ones where it asks me if I want to watch an ad for a reward, that's different. I chose to watch those."", ""Overall the game is really fun; I like the dragon collecting aspect, and the different battle options (main story, arena, dungeon). I wish there were a way to turn off the tutorial prompts (ex: when you level up and get access to a new farm, I don't need to be guided to the store), but they're only mildly annoying. I wish the events were a bit longer, most only run about a week, and I end up not making much progress on a busy work week."", ""It's a really fun game despite the wait time for eggs and habitats and such. The only thing that is really aggravating me is the constant pop up ads. I certainly won't stop playing it just because of that but it gets a bit annoying when I intend to collect food and an ad comes up and redirects me to that page because I accidentally clicked that instead of the farm. 4 stars for a great game. -1 for the ad situation."", 'Great game!!!! The customer support is there for you when you need them, everything is proportionate to your level, so its just as difficult to get certain things at a level 10 as a level 50. I recommend this game to anyone that wants something cool and fun to play, without the worry of being attacked by everyone and losing progress. Noone trash talks, and everything is very...""stressless"".', ""I think it's so cute. I really like collecting the dragons. Not really into the battling part. haha. I wish some of the special events were a bit easier to participate in. I can't believe how expensive some of the bundles are and I don't want to spend money anyway. But great graphics and enjoyable game. UPDATE: Pet peeve is the wait times for some of the side games. Waiting so long for a battle. You have 40ish battles to complete in a few days. Or 45min to collect coins/food/etc! Annoying!"", ""Gameplay is as fun and as high quality as ever, though with all the events that keep happening it's hard not to get burned out. The newest update made some nice changes to the layout of icons, like making the bubble to collect coins or food smaller, but I would have liked to make it so I can zoom out further. I'm not sure if it's just my device, but this makes things feel too cluttered. The size of quite a few of things, like the dragons in battles, are personal issues I'm having with the game."", ""I honestly think this is the best game of its type that I've tried. Unlike some of the other games of its kind, I still feel like I'm making progress and can earn gems (the game's premium currency) to unlock things, even if I don't play every day or that often when I do at times. The dragons are cute and have interesting designs, and there's plenty to collect! Ads are still a thing, of course, but being able to still progress without having to purchase things makes it more than managable!"", ""Absolutely love this game. So many things to do yet none are completely impossible. While spending money on the game might give you an advantage it's not completely necessary. There are a couple of things I would suggest making different though. Make it possible to add friends cross platform and make it possible to have more than one breeding den without having to pay money to do so. Should also note I normally hate games where I have to wait for things to grow, etc. This one is the exception though."", ""So, I haven't played this game in quite a while, but it was fun at first, to the point I was putting in money. Progression started slowing to a snails pace, then I realized I was only playing because I invested real world money and wasn't actually enjoying it anymore. It became repetitive with events. The habitat/dragon design feels stale. I'd be willing to give it another shot with some fresh content and some major game mechanic improvements/changes."", ""Very engaging and exciting! So much fun. I even told my bff to download it. Minor issues tho, and the game runs smoothly. I love the graphics and animations. I'm giving it 4 stars because I get the same ads ALL THE DAMN TIME. Its not filled with ads tho. Also, I can't forge any seals which is strange. Please fix that! I can't click out of it. I have to close the app then open it again. Things are expensive in the game. Events are hard for lower levels. Love DragonML!!!"", ""An all-around good game, the dragons are ADORABLE, but the unskipable pop-up ads are REALLY annoying. Having to watch ads to get a reward makes sense, having ads pop up as you're trying to do something in-game, so you accidently tap on the ad and have to leave the game doesn't make sense. But at the same time, it was the only game out of my 5 that saved my progress when I transferred over to a new phone, so that was awesome. But there's no settings for anything, and the notification sound is ugh"", ""The game is cute. The graphics are nice. The dragons are even cuter. I've been playing this game for a few days now. Get ready for random pop up ads during normal world play. To upgrade things you need diamonds and those to get faster than a few months will require real money. It's aggravating to say the least. The higher level you get the more fruit you need which costs in game money and the higher the level the more it costs. To remove bushes and trees and what not they cost 400-16k+ in coins."", ""I enjoy the game I remember loving the gameplay and came back to play again... Only to find out why I quit in the first place. INVASIVE ADS! I watch enough ads without them shoving more of them in my face everytime I try to do something. Some of the ads take way to long to skip. It's infuriating. Not to mention some of the events are unbalanced and you have to pay a lot money to get any prizes at all."", ""Love this game! Very cute graphics and its a good time killer. I am only giving this 4 stars because there is room for improvement. Idk if it's just me, but if the game offers me an option to watch ads to skip time (hatching, mssions, etc.), the ad will 95% of the time not load and say there is no connection. My problem with this is that the game will give me ads when there are no rewards (with no problems), but it won't load if I am trying to get a time cut/reward. Can someone fix this, please?"", ""Mostly good, popups are an issue. It's bad enough I have to watch the ads for cards and other things but to make an ad pop up while you are trying to do something, only for you to think you are clicking the game, then you are taken to the app page. That and everything takes way too long to unlock or procure. There definitely seems to be some balance issues with the cost of buildings, habitats, and food production in farms for the wait time. The only saving grace are the dragons, really.""]",False,"['es.socialpoint.DragonCity', 'es.socialpoint.MonsterLegends', 'com.gramgames.mergedragons', 'com.ludia.dragons', 'com.KnowledgeAdventure.SchoolOfDragons']","['com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA9HM', 'com.gameloft.anmp.sniper.champions', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDMHM', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA8HM', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftM5HM']",com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDOHM,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDOHM&hl=en&gl=us

- Various improvements and bug fixes.",CHANGELOG<br>- New skin for Revolv.<br>- New skin for R0nen.<br>- New skin for Seven.<br>- Various improvements and bug fixes.,"['Definitely one of my all time favorites now. I look forward to more skins and to see how far this game can go. My only gripe is the kill icon and similar ones always show up really close to the cross hair and it makes it very difficult to see anything. If there was an option to make those kinds of adjustments that would be stupendous!', ""It's simply just a easy to play and enjoyable Modern Combat game. Compared to 4 and 5 it has it's own unique play similar to N.O.V.A Legacy in some ways. The gameplay is pretty smooth and doesnt take much space on your mobile or pc. Controls are pretty easy to get use to and the rewards for grinding and ranking is worth it in my opinion. HOWEVER the pairing system and obtaining diamonds is difficult and at times gets annoying to grasp."", ""I've played this game for 4 months and paid as much as a PS5 game. Aside from it being a fun game with many good characters it has lots of issues that are forcing me to quit it. Maybe it's because I'm using a recently released Sony phone and the devs haven't been updating it to keep up with it but I'm sick of the glitches and the lag and the interface not fitting on my screen and just waiting forever for a button to pop up so I can move forward! It's just becoming increasingly a waste of time."", ""its not a bad game, granted improvement is needed, but the general theme of game is fantastic. now i did find a problem, at the beginning of each match, it doesn't load me in, it freezes on the map screen, the sounds play, but not the visuals, and when it does load at the end of the match it freezes on the end screen with Victory or defeat and it just stays there, if possible please fix."", ""everything so far, as far as gameplay and graphics, are great. not being able to use my index finger to shoot (can't put aim/fire button at the top of the screen) while turning at the same time is frustrating, loosing that split second that could have saved your life when it counted most. also, no voice chat makes communication impossible, so you have to resort to using discord or some other alt app, and friends have to make a clan just to be able to see each other in game or use squad code.."", ""It's a fun game and the graphics are good, if you have a device able to handle the high-processing. However, there are issues... The game constantly freezes & locks up, once you rank up enough to get into the game against real players instead of bots you can see that you're going to 'HAVE TO BUY' upgrades $$, the matchmaking is way off - high & low ranked players are pitted against each other all the time, and last of all once again as you rank up higher you see the rampant cheating of others."", ""This is possibly the best shooter on mobile. It's got really good balance and it doesn't cost anything to level up your characters. there are cosmetic stuff that's difficult to unlock but worth the effort. Characters aren't really unlocked too often but it is possible and the characters you do get are a lot of fun to play. It has full controller support and I highly recommend using one."", 'looks good. would give it a better review... if I were actually able to play the thing. Every time I start the app, the screen freezes, and it gets stuck on the intro sequence. Also, when I leave the app, I can still hear the ambient noise from the starting area. I am, or was, looking forward to playing this. Pleeaase fix this.', ""Desperately needs a better control scheme for those of us using an external controller. For some insane reason A is used to zoom, the left button is used to shoot, and the left and right triggers aren't used at all even though LT should be aim and RT should be shoot. It makes even less sense because Modern Combat 5 has a perfect control scheme for external controllers. Hope this is fixed soon, because it's an otherwise wonderful game that runs very smoothly even on my old Moto Z2 Play."", ""Game is less pay to win then when it was first launched but still really grindy. Controls are pretty good, but there really isn't much skill involved when playing. You can be standing still while shooting at someone and it's just a matter of who shot first really. Characters are unique and have pretty cool backstories which is pretty surprising. Graphics look good too. You can still buy your way to the leaderboards though but now at least, those who don't spend money have a better chance to win."", 'This is a very good POV shooter game and I would recommend this to anyone looking for one. The graphics, gameplay and player base is very good. my one downside is the controller mapping(optional, if you want the controller) the shoot,zoom, and ability is very different when compared to other games, but should this be fixed this would easily be #1', ""its a good game, but too basic, and too simple. Sure it can be a great game to pass the time but truth be told its far too grindy at the beginning, and not enough options for your game to be up to console quality gaming. If you want a good First Person Shooter, then remove the auto shoot option and add a crouch and prone button in the game. Otherwise you might as well just be moving your stick figure around while watching the fireworks go off. Neat game, but isn't as good as some"", ""It's great. The gameplay is good, the variety of guns and the characters abilities are almost all even and getting new characters is sort of balanced but the problems make it hard to play like how it's sometimes laggy in the menu or when playing since for some reason it's still ongoing since the beginning of the game and when I try to test out characters that I don't have it keeps glitching and choosing Knox."", ""when I downloaded the game when it first came out, it was horrible and especially the matchmaking wasnt good as well. however now, the graphic is very advanced and it's better. the graphics of the gameplay is good as console games, and it's very enjoyable. one thing though is that it needs more variety of choices in which game mode you want to play."", ""Well I had played a couple of games and at the time it was very smooth. But sometimes at the start of a new match my player bugs into walls or it would bug me into the middle of the map and I wouldn't be able to move. Overall an amazing game. But as for the glitches its annoying but it doesn't happen too often. Ihave screenshots of this bug."", ""If you like Rogue Company and/or Apex Legends, then this is definitely a game you want to add to your collection. Don't forget to read the menus, because I almost forgot to level up my characters on accident even after I did the game tutorial lol. A little while later I ran into slight difficulty, until I remembered, oh yeah I have to level my characters up. I sometimes wish for more game modes and maps, because I'm happy and enjoying the game already. Definitely Video Game Console Worthy! A+++"", 'I like this game alot, because the gameplay, the characters, specials, and all the characters are equally fun to play. I enjoy the gameplay the most because, I have been trying to find a game that could, work on my phone perfectly and that could entertaining. My only complaint about this game, is that the loading screen after a battle takes so long to load ,which leads me to exiting and refreshing the game ENTIRELY. But, the game is good at the end of the day. -Sincerely a satisfied customer.', ""The game is good and all but it has a few flaws when it comes to some of the characters, for example when you throw blaze's cluster bomb it magnet tours you after the first explosion. Another thing is that there seem to be a bug with monarch shooting mechanic cause in certain situations when both me and a player with low health are against each other I pull the trigger before I die and it shows a hit marker which means we both should have traded but I die (monarch) instead."", ""Compared to previous Modern Combat titles. This one feels less tactical and even lesser in customization. Some map parts feel reused and remodeled, okay for some nostalgia. Seems much like a doppelganger to Black Ops 4, just missing too much in controls. Lastly, I'm not one that enjoys colorful battle. I miss the realism of soldiers who look more so militarized and has some uniformity depending on classes, although customization is always a plus. I just can't take this to really be a game."", 'The game and its shooting and multiplayer mechanics are good. The main problem comes from the fact that you can only get new agents from loot boxes that have around a 1% chance to even get one, much less the one you want. For a game based on over 20 characters its insane to get around 2 free boxes a day or to pay for a large amount of them till you get the character you want. If it wasnt for this bussiness practice the game would be much better off', ""Controls glitches while playing(can't move or shoot), agents so OP that no matter how many times you shoot them they will kill you first and very fast. Also glitches every loading screen ie. Sometimes you can't even see the score board after game (the layout is there but no info, no names no points) same with the rewards screens because you have to wait until the animation and sound ends in order to go back to the lobby (which is very annoying)"", ""Great game. I love the way u made everything free to play. If I had to gripe, I'd make the clans, and the friend to friend thing accessible from the jump.. it hinders friends I introduce to it wanting to play it. But overall I love what you're doing. Alot of people dont understand mechanics and that's where the bad reviews coming from. U fixed most of their issues with armor introduction and unlike most ppl, I understand. Theres no way to fix ur server issues bc the game isnt big enough for that"", ""If you enjoy a game that constantly freezes and crashes, then this is the game for you! If you love terribly unbalanced matchmaking, i highly recommend :) if you enjoy paying money for something and getting something completely different for what you paid for, this is the one! Yes, it is fun! At least until you get to level 10! Be prepared to match up against players whose levels are 20 to 30 levels above yours :D have fun constantly losing, good times! Let's help this high level players out"", ""First time player experience its different than call of duty where some aspects are simplified but that doesn't take away from the fun. Your thrown right into battle tutorial is short and sweet, seems like and easy upgrade system (without the need for real world purchases) , and graphics are crisp depending on the capabilities of you device. In short this is good on to try out for yourself."", ""The game is solid! But the matchmaking is unbalanced and you can tell people pay there way through. If your not paying it takes awhile to obtain characters let alone leveling them up and unlocking the abilities/buffs. Game modes range but there's only a handful. The rewards system is somewhat balanced. with all this being said I played for 6 to 8 months and throughly enjoyed the game. I would recommend at least trying it."", 'Graphics and concept all amazing but as fps lacks a lot. Controls are super stiff makes movements and aiming slow so its frustrating and personally don\'t like auto shoot.. lacks the satisfaction of the ""shooting"" and making the kill. We should be able to aim with one button not double tap (doesn\'t seem to work too well). I think making the controls in designated buttons (ie call of duty) will help a lot.', ""NGL I love the game it looks cool, when I mean it looks cool is I mean that I try to open it. Then it opens and then it takes like 3 years to load. ( being over dramatic) but it doesn't load. I could it on my pc, I mean i can download it but... :\\ It will not load. Love the game graphics! FYI: I can't get it on mobile, me and my friend tried playing it with our phones, but either of us could get it to load. We even had a bet, to see if it would load or not.Love the graphics but Can't play it:("", 'I had to temporarly delete MCVS due to having school and being busy. When I downloaded it, it automatically starts a tutorial. I really think when joining the game, logging or signing in an account should be an option first before anything else. I connected to my original play store account, nothing had changed. I clicked ""restore"" I tried to load it three times waiting at least 15 minutes for all three. Is there any way to restore my old account?? I spent so much time on it and enjoyed it a lot', ""amazing graphics with solid gameplay. my only issue is mapping the controls. I have two triggers that can attach to my phone but the configuration wont let me get past the red zone. would definitely love it if you could take that off. other than that it's a solid game."", ""One of the WORST games I've played. It's overall unbalanced, there's a strong component of luck instead of skill, and it has a heavy but...subtle pay-to-win model. Paying for crates in order to acquire certain agents would make the game more fun for you. If you get an agent with a shotgun, you've won the jackpot. Any agent with a shotgun can kill you in 2-3 shots and you don't have to be accurate, because it's a shotgun. I'm sick of shotguns in any game, but this was beyond ridiculous. Not fun."", 'Love them game... 5 star worthy, but always room for improvement!!! Update: as I have advanced in the game, I have had issue on several occasions with being booted out of matches. After having completed nearly 90% of an given match, I will get booted out; losing all point acquired in the match. Very frustrating, as I had high hopes for this game. I seriously hope this situation is solved, as my friends and I really like playing; but it seems it may be time to look elsewhere!!!', 'ive played this game for a while and really like it but its so buggy. it freezes and glitches alot ESPECIALLY when youre playing a match. Its very inconvenient. it disconnects you from the game and it takes forever to reconnect. by the time you do reconnect youve already lost the match. It also especially freezes when youre shooting at someone, by the time it unfreezes youve already died. it takes forever to load too.', ""This game is good, very good. So why 3 stars? It keeps crashing. And it isn't the game that crashes, but the server. Just right now I wont a 2-1 tournament and by the time it hit 100% on the last round, game froze. I tried to close and run game again, it won't load anymore. Come on Gameloft, you have a great game here! Get a better server that it deserves!"", 'Top shelf FPS. No doubt about it. Not perfect but close enough to get that fifth star. Variety is a strong point with very different combatants. Gets a bit overboard with the gear maybe. Big spending accelerates your gain of power but can still be done without. No substitute for skill, strategy and coordination. Does ok building teams. One highly skilled player can carry his team but usually earns it.', 'Great game! Good graphics and very fun gameplay. You can use a game controller if you want because the devs built in controller functionality (awesome!!) The things that need to be fixed with the game are 1. Optimization needs some improvement sometimes the game can lag 2. When using controller press and hold option scope does not work you still have to double press which is annoying 3. Cannot remap controls on controller. Overall a great game and still one of my favorites.', ""Hi Gameloft! I just want to say, i really like this game, the graphics are great and the gameplay is awesome. But sometimes the game will crashed, I don't know why but i'm just using a low device. Can you please fix this for low devices, i literally enjoying the game but it will crashed, i keep repeating, i literally clear data this game again and again. And nothing happened. :("", 'I just started playing in a week and for me its a great FPS game. Simple, fun and fast paced but there are some bugs and lag/freeze issues while playing. When navigating in the main screen, sometimes the screen freezes and it also happens while searching for opponents and after selecting your agent in the match. Sometimes bugs happens after the match was finished, the display icons in the main screen turns to be squared shapes. Hope GAMELOFT fix this and optimize the game for a better gameplay.', ""Okay, so the game is nice ,no glitches, no problem while playing, smooth controls and nice graphics. Only the problem sometimes is that the team matching isn't done properly and this creates a chaos while playing cuz the team becomes unbalanced and doing teamwork becomes a bit harder. And if you play a match other than the classic you've got only two agents to choose and this is also trouble some as you are not able to choose agents as per the requirements of the condition. Plz fix this problem"", ""The graphics, had to say, Gameloft never disappoints me. But there are bugs, for example i cant play although i am already in the match so i had to restart the app. Also for competitive arena, the final score display is wrong. Super wrong. I dont know if its just me or everybody are having the same problem, but when im playing in classic mode, the final score display is accurate. So maybe you need to work on that. And it's kind of hard to get new agents from the loot crate. Maybe you should change that too. Since asphalt 8 and 9 is pretty easy to obtain new cars. Well not that easy but fair enough. So maybe you need to work on that. And also sometimes the game crashes, just sometimes, maybe out of 10 games it'll crash for 3 to 4 times. But overall its a good game. If you fix all the problem above, it'll be better than any shooting games out there. The autoshoot is really really really helpful by the way which makes it better than pubg or any other games. Thats all. And hope you fix all those bugs up there. Thank you."", ""it's my first impression. the matchmaking is so slow and it keep reconnecting but i like the gameplay, it just need to be made longer gameplay it's too fast. that's from me thank you. about the control, can you make the button can be moved anywhere in the screen? i'm a claw player and its hard to play because i can't put the button on the top left or top right. that's from me thank you, keep it good!.""]",False,"['com.madfingergames.legends', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftINHM', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftNOHM', 'com.superbitmachine.armajet', 'com.gamedevltd.destinywarfare']","['com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA9HM', 'com.gameloft.anmp.sniper.champions', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDMHM', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA8HM', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDOHM']",com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftMVHM,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftMVHM&hl=en&gl=us

Lately it's not been working so well. It takes 3-4 times to get the game to actually open. Then it tries to connect to Facebook, freezes, tells me Facebook isn't responding, then crashes. There's also an awful lag when playing and the pop-up ads come up at random times. One wrong tap and you're sent to a different page and have to try to load the app all over again. If it takes 20mins just to get the game to load, then I don't want to bother with it."", 'I used to REALLY enjoy this game. I loved collecting characters & making my own Disney Kingdom. But there\'s too many attractions & never enough land to put them on. I don\'t like the ""level up lands"" feature, I have no interest in x-amount of plants, x-amount of statues, x-amount of benches, etc. I wanna try to fit as many attractions & concessions as possible. You can\'t really make your own kingdom now, & you definitely have to spend money if you want all the characters or finish quests.', 'Tons of fun. If I had a caveat, it would be that additional land gets prohibitively expensive. I currently have 14 attractions and have nowhere to put them. Since new space starts at 2,000,000 potions at this point in the game, it would take me about month to save up enough to get space to build three or four of those attractions, then each land expansion after that goes up by 1,000,000 potions each time. But overall, I love the game and all they Disney nostalgia. Just eager for more!', ""You can't win any of challenges without buying it for about $500. I have been playing this for 5 years and have only won 3 trophies to advance in the game. You cannot join a team to help each other out. They limit you the number of characters at 100 you can use. But I have about 300 and need to constantly add and remove them to complete challenges or level them up. There is no more fun in Disney anymore. Unless your on the Disney side of the fence"", 'I love this game. Been playing for years, I am thoroughly addicted. Except for the side games. There is literally no way, at all, to win one of those side games unless you buy a bunch of bundles. Even if you set multiple alarms and times on each action for the side quest. You can get on every half-hour - hour and collect all the little creatures walking around & still not collect all the characters or defeat Maleficent. The actions for everything take too long to ever complete these side quests.', ""Really great game despite I've been stuck on the story mode for over a year. In order to progess in story mode a Ratatouille Relic token to upgrade an Attraction has to drop. 5 is needed for upgrade. Problem is this token never drops. I've tried everything to get this token even obtaining extra chests. So after a year plus I'm done with trying to progress in story mode and will just play the events."", ""Love this game!! I play it everyday! The only thing I have an issue with how to get more gems quickly. I noticed how we get potions as rewards for quests, floats and attractions, but hardly any gems. Free gems are only on the floats if you're lucky or two for watching a few ads. I don't want to spend a lot of money to get the needed amount to get event bundles. Otherwise awesome game and worth playing!"", 'Enjoyed playing for years. Unfortunately recently it would not load past the splash screen. After trying the clear cache, I uninstalled and reinstalled. This restarted the game from the beginning. So apparently I lost all my progress. Had this happen once before, when I got a new phone. The app was fairly new and I had to start over then. Not doing it again.', ""It's a fun game. But I find it annoying that you can't get all of the characters unless you spend diamonds or money to get diamonds to get the chests they are in. That needs to change! It also takes a lot of patience and grinding to get very far. I played it before on another phone and stopped because of the grinding. Giving it another go because I love Disney but I have a feeling it's just the same."", ""After having it only for a day, I've already grew a deep love for this game. The story and plot has had me playing for a good few hours. My only complaint is that sometimes it will randomly kick me out of the game, but other than that it's amazing! Some postive feedback/suggestions that I would like to give is that I think the game would be even more amazing if you could manage to add characters from Kingdom Hearts and Descendants. Thanks so much for the magical experience that is this game!"", 'I love this game. Been playing for over 4 years. The graphics and attention to detail are amazing. Gameloft/DMK also listens to the feedback provided by players and makes changes based on suggestions. Edited: the last several updates have been more of a money grab. They have been challenging despite having all the characters needed. Also...need more land!', ""Game play on the computer is the worst...I have been playing for years and lately it has been buffering continuously. Now it can't even play the game. It doesn't show up on my Facebook page. I'm having to spend money on chests with the hope of getting anything useful. I have a brand new computer over 1tb of memory, less than 5% of hard drive used any still can't play. I'm to the point of quitting and finding a new game to play."", ""Update: events are very hard unless you sign in every two hours to get prizes, getting tokens to welcome new characters takes forever, and happiness goes down too quickly. The upside is the design and character attributes, so cute to watch them do different things. It is one of my favorite phone games, as I've played for so long."", ""It is getting harder and harder to enjoy free play, even when watching all the ads for rewards. Paying to play is often a gamble (I've spent money on chests with no value) and it's taking longer and longer to make progress. It has a lot of potential but it feels more and more like a greedy money-grab every day. EDITED TO ADD: Since the developer has asked for more specific feedback, I'm going to leave that here so it's publicly available. -Get decorations out of premium chests. If I pay money, don't insult me with a bench (or any other decorations). I'm paying for the characters and you know it. -Make events more realistic. People shouldn't have to set 2 hour alarms and interrupt sleep and work in order to succeed. It's just a game. Make it realistic. I used to do all the events, but after doing the math on some of the recent ones I haven't bothered. You literally have to participate every two hours, which is ridiculous. -Increase the longevity of happiness. It used to last much longer... but now it depletes so quickly that it's nearly pointless. -Increase the drop rates. I'm working on the Peter Pan characters now and the drop rates are abominable. It takes forever to get the next character, which causes people to lose interest due to the slow pacing. There's probably more that I could add here but I'll stop for now. If those changes were made, it would drastically improve this game."", ""Fun in the beginning and getting started, but soon after you realize you don't get nearly enough rewards for the quests you complete, especially with how long the quests take to do, and to accumulate certain rewards takes forever since you don't get much rewards when you do finally complete the quest. Unfortunately, it seems likeits just a game to get you to spend money just to obtain certain buildings and characters. Im going to try to keep it for another week, but idk if it will last that long"", ""I have played this game for over 2 years now. I have always loved it until recently when it keeps shutting off on me and/ or getting all pixelated. There has been days that I can't play it. It always seems to do this during events and it's so frustrating because I can't participate in getting new characters and advancing. So disappointed and disgusted I'm ready just to uninstall it completely!!!!!"", 'This game has been my favorite game to play for years. I love collecting the characters and progressing through them. With that said, it is getting to be less and less fun. They are making the new content and characters much to hard to get. I have a job and cannot set alarms to play game every 2 to 4 hours, all night and day throughout the whole event. This seems to be the only way to get the new characters.', ""I LOST MY STREAK! 238 day streak gone bcuz I was forced to restart after the game crashes either while loading or within a few minutes of starting up. Had 3 gems and could've watched the ads for those extra two! But instead of letting us go to the main game & then go back to the calendar via the icon, the calendar remains & your only two options are start over or buy gems! Thanks a lot butt monkeys, because of the incompentence & CONSTANT crashing...dissapointed in 2017 & now 2022 (reinstalled)"", 'I have to move from 4 star to 3 only because the platform has decided to move from a you can play with out spending money, it will be a little harder but the costs were for the most part low, at most was about $10. NOW the only way to play and to have fun is to pay money and it is getting higher and higher each update, which is every month. Two years ago it was 4 stars because it cost money, but was not to expensive. Now it is 3 stars because the fun almost depends on money and more of it.', ""Best mobile Disney game I've played, but it's increasingly difficult to unlock characters without having to buy gems or to access enough space to place the new content into my park. And each event has been a rehash of the last most times. I'm tired of facing Maleficent each time. Change it up a bit please."", ""I really enjoy this game, but there a couple reasons I can't rate it higher than a 3. It takes forever to earn magic points compared to the amount you need to purchase attractions or expand. The wait times are a bit long with some of them being 12-24 hour waiting periods. I forget half the time to come back and check because I've done got side tracked. And you can only get certain characters by using real money, so unless you're prepared to use real money to purchase characters, you do without."", 'While I enjoyed the game, it is impossible to ignore how offensively slow and absurd it is to progress in any fashion. I understand you have to make money, but this game has fallen into the classic ""restrict progression as much as possible in order to manipulate players into shoveling money our way via microtransactions to accelerate progress"" kind of game. If this were to be drastically improved, you got yourself an amazing game. And no, ""every app does this"" isn\'t a valid argument.', ""I love this game. It's an easy, slow-paced idle game with great graphics. If you like to progress quickly in video games, this isn't the game for you. If your kid is playing put a password protection on purchases. In true Disney fashion, there are dozens of super cool things to buy in every chapter of the game. Edit: I see other reviews about crashing. I've never had a problem with the game. Even on my old cheap phone the game worked great on wifi."", 'I\'m not sure I would recommend it. I have started it 3 times and when I get to level 16 it reverts back to level 1 with a new ID number. I play it on my laptop.. I have emailed the company twice and each time I get a standard answer which is not helpful at all and recomends facebook or reinstalling. if this game cannot be played with out connecting facebook then this game is not for you. I really enjoyed playing and I hoped I could move forward without purchasing anything! I\'m giving it a ""one"" star because I did enjoy playing but very didappointed that I couldn\'t continue.', ""Overall it's a decent game. I originally started playing on my pc then had to have the developers switch it to my phone. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SPEND MONEY IN THIS GAME. Granted if you don't it takes longer but when has learning patience ever been a bad thing? I'll admit it's very boring when you first start out but if you patiently level up and expand your park it ends up being very fun. Only giving it 4* because of difficulty getting gems (which they have made much easier since I started playing)."", ""I originally gave this game 4 stars, but in the 2 years I have played it the developers managed to take all the fun out by requiring certain layouts and making events nearly impossible unless you spend your life playing and setting alarms to log in. It also now requires more money than I want to spend in order to complete events. It's just not fun anymore."", ""It's a really cute game. Graphics are good Although with the latest updates certain things changed. Like no character voices anymore, small things but definitely missed a ton. You can play free, but its very difficult to progress,(characters/attractions) without spending money. But it is possible. And a couple of times my data was erased and I had to restart from the very beginning...other than those things I did enjoy playing the game very much."", 'It\'s an ok game. Not worth spending any real money (which it requires a lot of $$ to get the ""good"" items) The reason it\'s 2 stars is because there\'s so MANY pop up ads! I don\'t mind watching ads for free gems, I willingly click on those, but I\'ll be in the middle of choosing a task and then BAM! ad. Also takes forever to collect items and get through the story line, which is all over the place! Again, an OK game, but not worth spending real $', ""I love this game! I've been playing for well over a year. The chests are annoying (but completely random, NOT based on what you click on) but in a game with so much content they have to find a way to fund this game. There are basically monthly updates and frequent limited time events to introduce new characters so there's always something to work on. This is not a quick play, rush to the end game. It takes patience to earn potions and tokens but that gives you a reason to check the game every day (or 2, 3, 4, maybe more times depending on your schedule). I've even had my game crash and reset and a quick email with CS had it restored in a few days. This is by far my favorite game and I love getting to customize my park and collect the various characters. I definitely recommend playing DMK!"", 'The game is fun to play, however there are quite a few things that are not great. The app crashes constantly. I have tried everything to fix this, ensuring the app is up to date, closing it completely, turning my phone off, uninstall and reinstall. The amount of potions you need to buy land is ridiculous and if I have a character maxxed out in level, I shouldnt still be getting their tokens. I will keep playing but not for long if my app keeps crashing.', 'Have played this game for over a year. I have enjoyed building my kingdom. I\'m not very happy with the new ""wishes/happiness "" controls as it is almost impossible to keep the happiness in the park at ecstatic level. It would be nice to have more land available at lower cost (1,ooo,ooo magic is a bit extreme). Having 25 attractions in storage due to not enough land is disappointing. Other than the few complaints, I do enjoy the game. The graphics are truly amazing.', ""I love everything disney and have been playing for awhile. But this game is sometimes very stressful when your trying to level up or get certain characters or items. Everything costs diamonds and they are hard to get or save up for, unless you want to spend your own money. I love the game it's fun and entertaining but getting items and leveling up is hard and takes a long time. I hope they fix that issue with the diamonds. Other than that. It's really fun and enjoyable!!!"", ""When this game first came out 2 years ago, it was a fun city-building type game great for casual players to pick up every few hours and play. It was fun to complete quests and unlock new characters and the special events and character unlocks kept me coming back. However, the last several special events have sucked the fun right out of the game. Unless you're able to check the game immediately after a quest is finished, you can never unlock all. Impossible to play for the avg working person"", ""I used to love playing this game! Granted some of the times for characters were and still are a little long. But they made up for it in prizes. With the new update it is a chore to keep my happiness level up! It drops drastically and I can't play the game every 5 seconds to maintain it! Please fix that problem and I will rate it higher! Also things have become WAY to expensive and you are not listening to your people! Please fix the game back to the way it used to be!"", ""Used to be a fun game, but all of the changes have made the game into a job. The events have timers and require round the clock play to complete. The events only happen once so if you dont complete it you are forced to gamble on loot boxes to get the characters you missed. The events that require toons are purposefully chosen to be paid for toons or it is even more difficult to complete. The game always had a cost but they had a good balance and a fair cost, but that isn't the case anymore."", ""I have been playing this game from day 1. Great graphics, love the characters. It used to be fun to play, but no more. There are constant events that are nearly impossible to complete (and literally impossible in some cases unless you spend real money or in-game currency that costs real money). Unnecessary recent updates have only made the game more convoluted. And as for designing your park, decorations can't even be bought anymore, nor is there enough land to put everything on."", ""It's a decent game and fun to unlock characters but if you want to get anywhere with storylines, be prepared to either spend an insane amount of real money or have it take forever. They dont listen to feedback from players about needing additional time for events and more land for less money, which is frustrating. It's a good time killer if you dont take the game too seriously or care about progressing at all."", 'In general, my wife and I really enjoy the game. I\'ve rated it lower because I think the creators are getting too greedy as far as forcing players to pay for things with money to advance. It\'s fairly difficult to complete any of the events without spending money, and the newest tower event seems almost impossible unless you spend a lot on refreshers and gems. I don\'t mind paying for the occasional character bundle, but I may stop playing if it becomes much more ""pay to play.""', 'Play with REAL money unless you love being frustrated and disappointed. Even then you still might be. You can\'t really get the good stuff unless you pay up for it. That\'s life. They have to make money too. At least once a week something wrong happens. They did correct a couple mistakes. I\'m a disabled Firefighter. I\'ll waste my time on this game but I won\'t waste my money right now. The graphics are great. The music\'s the same. They could mix it up a little or add new tunes..It takes FOREVER to get things done without spending real money. I had 5 stars last year. But after today big screw up. It\'s at a 2. Thought about uninstalling because of the mess up this morning but we\'ll see. Still might. Its a good ""game"" but it has problems. Long review but I think I was fair.', ""The game sounds very appealing and checks all the boxes for my desire to collect all things Disney, but does so in a dastardly way. The game requires constant play and excessive spending of money to even attempt to complete offered collections. Do yourself a favor and steer clear for now as greed seems to be the driving factor of this production.

Lost everything back to the beginning. Gave it another try today. So many ads! Each item on the to-do list required an ad before you could see it. AND the long version too! You can't skip and some give you 2 wait screens before you can close the ad and get back to the game. Played 5 minutes and spent more time watching ads than actually playing the game. Ridiculous! I gave it another shot but I shouldn't have wasted my time. Hope you don't either."", ""this has been happening to me days ago. For some unexpected reason all the animal sounds has gone crazy and even it sounds when I put it in the storage. The Wolf and Fox sounds appears even though they are not there as if they wen to priority mode or something, and when I give a ball to the dog, its sound doesn't come out and even the fight. I tried putting all animals in the storage and deactivating the sound, closing the app and running it but doesn't fix it. I'm using a Galaxy A7. plz fix it."", ""Awesome game. Installed 4 times, went up to level 45+ couple of times and also once reached untill the last plot to be purchased but was never able to complete the game. Ridiculously all the things are lost wiped out and you just don't have the contents to continue. It's like you have wasted months of progress in a split second. This was the last time I got this game thinking the developers must have fixed the problem but no. They care less for it."", 'The game was best and I played it since many years. But the latest version is causing a lot of stupid problems. It asks to update to play, where there in no update on play store. Also, those upgrades which used to get finished in 3 hours is now needing 11 days (Upgrading Manor to Unlock Collection Room). Also, the daily prize from the doghouse is showing 12 days! Please fix all these bugs, it is very frustrating.', ""Suddenly your farm, the animals and the manor disappeared! Just plain green field left. Lol. Hahaha 🤣. The game is fun and time consuming. But you need to fix this issue. Glitchy game! So if I want to continue, I might need to uninstall and re-install the app. Then I'll lose my progress and start over again. Then the issue might happen again, LoL, 😁."", ""It's addictive. But a total waste of time because you'll lose all the progress along with manor and everything at some point and it's very very frustrating. Days and months spend on this game will be wasted. I've played this game several times in past 7 years. It's the same problem everytime. We lose everything"", ""hey can you please fix the game? we really enjoyed playing it. But somehow all the fields are empty and there is no way to get the progress back. We need to reinstall the game and start from zero again.

I have downloaded it about 10 times in the past 5 years and each time I get far into the game everything dissappears and I can't get it back.

Don't waist your time, it's such an addictive game but then everything gets lost in a split second at random. 😔"", ""I don't seem to know how to rate this game it's very interesting and tasking, the only problem I have is that I can't open more space in the kitchen and also in the feedmill.

I can't get much work done when the kitchen space is just 3slots."", ""The time is the problem, it shows 169 days for something to be done like the renovations. To send a receive things from neighbours is 4050 days and it should be 24 hours.The game freezes a lot when you play and sometimes when you log in it just goes blank so you literally can't play. To harvest takes long also so there are too many bugs and issues with the game."", ""As much as I love it, I dislike it when it crash and how the cooking space can't upgrade no matter the level you get to except you purchase with money why would I want to keep wasting money on game that crash anytime. , I really hope the developer can look into these issues cause the game is quite fun to me. I really hope the developer can look into the way the game crash mostly when I visit my neighbor, it has crashed 3times in 2 months now. I have uninstalled it. I really love playing the game"", ""Played this year's ago and loved it, thought I would give it another go, however it still has the same issue as before. Get so far in and you lose everything and have to delete and reinstall start again till it all dissapears again?!! And way too many foxes and wolves constantly appearing all the time. Would be nice to finish this game one day, but this issue has never been sorted over the years. Shame 😓😓😓"", 'This is very good game.

Kindly fix this so that others will not experience this. Thank you."", ""Pretty fun each time I get it... That's the only issue though. If I redownload it, I have to start over. From zero. It's kind of frustrating tbh, seeing as the average Android phone has like 2 years of life on average; and who wants to replay 2 years of lost gameplay? Me apparently 😅 Ity loads of fun otherwise as far as time management games go. So it gets 4 stars for that."", ""**PLEASE MAKE TIME TO CHECK THE REVIEWS ABOUT THE PLAYERS' SUGGESTIONS, COMMENTS, AND GAME EXPERIENCE** I uninstalled this back then because all of my properties disappeared even the Manor. This was the second time to install this, I hope it really fixed its bugs and problems. Also, please put an option in the settings that the game progress can be saved via google play games, etc. It would be a waste of money if we'll buy in-app purchases but we weren't able to save our game progress."", 'I\'m starting to dislike this game. Whenever I opened the app my cash keeps decreasing. For example, I have $26 cash. It\'s not that bad. But when I closed the app because I\'ve got better things to do and then I\'ve decided to open it again, I noticed that my cash left is now $17 which is absolutely disappointing for the reason that I have not purchased anything. Additionally, one of the things I also hate are the ""ads"". The ads keep showing everytime I am pressing menus or options on the game.', ""The game is really good, and I have been impressed by the 'get cash or coins for a video' thing. Earlier, when I used to play this game, I thought it was a bum, but now I can buy the costly items too. But there's only big problem that is making the game slightly boring, and as far as I think is bothering everybody, that is, slow progress. It is making the fun decrease. Please mend that problem, otherwise this game should have received it's 5th star."", 'Atleast 4 years ago, I once played this game. I deleted it and the progress wasn’t saved also. Forgetting the reason for deleting it, I started playing it again and with the thought of reviewing it 5★ I read some reviews which helped me remember why I deleted it. A few days after buying sunny acre, the game went blank. Everything was just green. Nothing else was there. It made me soo mad I didn’t play it second time. I hope the problem is fixed cause I intend to complete it this time.', ""I downloaded it all again, it's a good app okay there's no pop-up ads for me, easy level up because I've been playing this for a few years before but i deleted it the app never changed it's great except it's kinda online it's great tho. Edit: I discovered a glitch where it would log-out of the app with a black screen. Please fix it. :/"", ""There is one annoying thing with this game and this is the FIFTH time it has happened. I come back from visiting a neighbour's farm and the next thing, my whole land is empty. NOTHING. This is a permanent glitch that has been happening since last year or two years ago and nothing has been done to fix it. All my progress wasted and gone down the drain!!! The least that could happen is save a person's profile on the cloud, but this is rubbish.

Only problem I have is that all of a sudden recently all my plots, animals, plants, barn etc all disappeared don't know why. Even the sounds tend to go off even without being turned off. Please fix this its becoming a real pain & nuisance. Coz i really love this game"", ""Played this game 5 years ago I got to level 32, logged in and everything in my farm had vanished. I had to restart all over and it happened like 2 times. Making cash was extremely difficult, except paying with real money, complained but no response from the developers & i quit the game. But i came across it 2 months ago and saw some major changes, now u can earn cash from viewing ads which is an improvement. My major concern is that my progress doesn't vanish again after getting to a high level."", ""Technical issue , bugs , whenever I was trying to play ads its closes down own and lost whole game. Can't show anything but empty land. But the coins and notes were there . Very disappointed worst issue , worst game technical dept. After playing that level .

Reinstalled this game after 1-2 yrs when it suddenly erased all my progress at level 24. Now, when this issue has been resolved, there's another one. All the things that are scheduled to return in 24 hrs (dog bonus, request to neighbor, etc.) are reappearing in 5 days or even more... Even after such a long time its clock shows that still there are some hours left. All this is making the gameplay very irritating. Request the makers to fix this ASAP !!!"", ""This game is really fun but it crashes so much. After every small task you get an ad or the game crashes. Sometimes it crashes for me when I push a single button. It's really fun and has a lot of potential but the crashes make it almost unplayable."", ""The game is fun only it crash anytime.

Animals, crops, cooking, expanding, visit neighbors, this game has everything. But, you cannot save your data if you uninstall it, all lost even if you connect through Facebook.

Also there's a glitch with the fox..after killing it the fox remained behind..and now that spot is a black hole..the dog and fox are stuck in the same spot..and after a while a bull also wandered there and now that's stuck too..i can't tap that spot because if i do then the dog attacks on a loop and nothing changes"", ""It is so harfull to our devices!!

Now I can't even access my farm because it became into a plain land. So, I decided to uninstall it. I will come back in a few years maybe. I hope this will be fix. I miss my farm.

It brings back the blocked memories of playing new york nights demo when i was 7 or 8 on my mom's tmobile phone and the game would end and i would wish i could get the full game so bad and now I can play one of the at night games full for free and its amazing. The only part that I dont like is how tiny the screen is. I wish it was asjustable. Im use to screens being bigger plus makeing a dark mode would be nice because the over all app is very.. Pastel like... But thats all. Thank you"", ""Love the concept and the execution is mostly great too. My only real problem has to do with the control layout - the D-pad in particular seems a tad too small and there's no way to resize. In general it seems like there's a lot of wasted space there to have such small buttons. Some choice in frame styles or better yet, a full-screen or 2x option would be cool (if NES emulators can do it, why not here) but those are minor gripes."", ""I do remember some of these games but I only downloaded this to see if Zombie Infection was here and it was. I haven't played Zombie Infection since I was like 6 years old, that was like 13 years ago, but I remember beating and enjoying the game. I'm glad I'm able to play the game without having to buy a keyboard phone. However, it would be better if we could have the option to make the screen and the controls bigger and the option to have joystick controls too"", 'Its 30 free games. All great in thier own way. Two problems; 1. The controls are sometimes unresponsive. You push to jump and it takes three tries until it does. 2. In portrait mode the game screen is super small. From the pictures, it looks twice as big as it does in screen. In landscape mode its fine. All in all, definetly worth the download', ""I used to play a lot of these old titles on Verizon flip phones back in the day, and it's great to see them remastered in 2020. My only real complaints are that the controls can be a little clunky and unresponsive, and I ran into a bug with Alien Quarantine that wiped out my save data for that game. So it could use a few minor improvements. Still a fantastic app, though, and a great callback to GameLoft's glory years. Kinda stinks that Bubble Bash 3 got left out, though. :("", 'I know that this is a collection of games originally made for ""dumb phones"", but most of the game are pretty bad even for dumb phone standards. It\'s free and if like at least one of the games it\'s probably fine, but for me I couldn\'t find a game that I could even like. The few games that actually are good are held back by the bad controls. If you have a controller connected to your phone/tablet (assuming it\'s supported by the emulator) it might be better and you might be able to actually play them, however I currently don\'t have a controller that I could try because I don\'t own an android compatible controller. I personally think that instead of just using an emulator to play the games I think that they should have been remade to work directly with android, giving them a newer experience with better graphics. They don\'t need to be hd remastered versions, but just using an emulator that converts button inputs into touchscreen inputs is not the way to go.', 'This is a nice collection of games from different genres. Sounds and graphics are great. Difficulty is set just right. Doesnt take much storage either. My ONLY complaint is, THE CONTROLS ARE HORRIBLE. In a game like Soul of Darkness, the jumping is difficult because the ""up"" button is for jump and changing weapons is ""down+right"". Commands get mixed up. Please allow for remapping. Other than that...GREAT JOB!', ""I enjoy the variety. Great games, fun to play. Two things I would like. One: Bigger screen. Though, it isn't too bad considering handheld screens if the GB and GBC. The second, and more important one, controller support. The touch controls work, but since if the games would benefit from being able to use bluetooth or OTG support for controllers."", ""I wanted to play the Block Breaker games, and it looks like the originals were well-designed. However, the controls are absolutely horrid. You're stuck trying to use tiny touchscreen buttons. Even spending half of my time watching my thumbs so I can press the buttons correctly, I still kept missing them somehow and losing as a result. What these games really need are actual hardware buttons like they were originally designed for. Unfortunately, there is no support for controllers."", ""This is legit the games (if you played them before on older generation phones or Nintendos) from the past presented to you in a nice package. No payments or ads, just 30 games, all very familiar or not, from Gameloft's Classics given to us. Though, it does get a little to get adjusted to with the screens being rather small and bright colors (would like a dark mode and enlarge for the entire app) and with certain games screen tearing or glitching here and there. Not perfect, but is free and good."", ""Good Game compilation can't say anything wrong about that 30 for 1 but wish there was an option for remapping the controller layout. Just at least a resize. I always find the on screen controls to be either too small or just in the wrong spots on games. In this case they're just a little too small. But I'm just one guy"", 'No ads AT ALL and no paying for anything. 30 games in one?! So much variety and fun, seriously awesome! My only complaint are the controls (just an itty bit too small and awkward, but not too terrible. Turning the phone sideways to enlarge the screen would be lovely and help wonders.) Thank you for this time - killer during COVID! :)', ""Installed this to play Block Breaker 2 Deluxe, but the D pad isn't the best. Sometimes without warning the launchpad in-game would still drift to the right or left after I let go of the button. Lots of lives were lost because it kept going one direction. Plus, the boss levels aren't even in the game anymore. They were so creative and fun... It was an okay experience for the nostalgia but I probably won't go back to this game."", 'Some of these games are really cool! Soul of Darkness and Zombie Infection are my faves. However I would love to see the controls become customizable, as unfortunately they are not so user friendly. On Soul, it would be great to have a jump button instead of the rather awkward up arrow. Then it would be a great 5 star game.', ""This has 30 older games one of which took me 8 years to find after being delisted on the vcast service era w Verizon and flip keyboard phones. Zombie infection!!!! its a little jank but it's meant for a flip phone w the d pad and doesn't translate the best over to touch.. But still bearable on half the collection of 30 games. One will be fun just download and see!. And they don't put a heavy load on the battery in my use of a Motorola g stylus w/o service, whole collection only like 100mb total"", ""Just about the perfect experience, and the easiest way to experience these suddenly very hard-to-find games. I can't deduct stars for this, but the inclusion of so many sequels specifically highlights the lack of certain games (the original Miami Nights and Date or Ditch are deeply personal losses for me), but I quietly hope that a patch will add more beloved classics to this miraculous archive. Long may she reign."", 'I really like the old style games you can play on here. The few things I would criticise on is the small and hard controls that makes my character go in different directions than I wanted it too and the screen size is small that I had to move my phone closer to see better. Hope in the next patch they add some options to make the buttons bigger or screen sizing option but I really like playing those old style games very much as I played one of them on the DSI', 'Everything is ok, but the Dpad kill the fun in games like Soul of Shadows. This game have a lot of platforms where is necessary to do precise directional jumps and is almost impossible to do it with the dpad. The virtual Dpad only 4 directions and trying to a left or right jump is way to difficult. In the original game I was able to do this kind of jump using the keys 1 or 3 on the phone. You can have this keys where the X and Y are located and the game will be better.', ""It was ok, I mean the screen could've been full screen and I get it, it's like this for the style and nostalgia or something. The games are fun don't get me wrong, it's just the controls and the screen. Every time I try to press a button, I end up pressing the wrong button or missing the button because of the controls. Can you at least add a controls and screen option in the settings in the game?"", ""Gave 3 stars because while the games themselves were fun back in the day, it's almost impossible to play them in the format presented here. Games like Brick Breaker, Midnight Bowling, and Midnight Pool are the main ones; the tiny screen you play them on makes it almost impossible to see what's going on. If this game is given the options for touch as well as full screen, I'll change my rating."", ""Thought I'd be playing the original NOVA fps, but that was too good to be true. Instead I was treated to one of those oldschool motorola games. I tried most of them, but NOVA was the obvious standout for me and really surprised me. It's kind of amazing to see how intuitive and ambitious this little mobile game was- in its own quaint little way ofc. Even having the *lightest* of metroid elements. Really fun. Worth the download alone. I'd actually love to see a remake of this one done properly."", ""Should be playable in full screen (or at least half screen), the little window is too small for many of the games to be playable. The controls are ok but really should be a joystick for better response. All in all it's not bad, just not very playable on today's larger screens."", 'Great compilation of Java-era phone games! I\'ve never heard of any of these games but they are classic knock-off Gameboy Advance styles circa 2005-2011. From solitaire to dating and MetroidVania, thirty games are in this well done collection. Not one has a pay to win lootbox to be found. No proper Bluetooth ,(Xbox One or generic) support really hurts this. I can connect.. but the A on my controller is mapped to ""L"" and B only escapes the game. No other buttons work. The d-pad is intermittent.', ""I love this collection. These old games are great and it's amazing to be able to play them again. I can't believe they are offering all of this for free without even any ads. I really hope they put together more collections like this in the future with the games missing from this one. Honestly if they added some more games and polished up the interface, they could even port it to consoles and I would pay money for it."", 'Awesome game. 30 games to choose from is sweet. There is only 2 things I can complain about with this game. The controls dont seem to respond immediatly sometimes with the d pad. And i wish that in landscape mode, the controls were just lower on the screen. Over awesome game tho, definitly worth getting if ur into arcade games', ""Completely free. Completely awful controls. It's a nice gesture but these games are absurdly hard to play. This is some worst in class touch dpad / buttons treatment. Also, you'll never play 80% of these games. They're from the pre iPhone era - soul of darkness and a few others will occupy you for 10 minutes. The rest are auto passes. Skip it - no reason to endure these controls, even at the price of free."", 'Wow. Finally Gameloft did it. When I started using Android I always missed these games. Even tried several emulators to play them. This is a great concept. I totally loved it. One star is reduced for the controls. You should add a numeric T9 keypad and arrange the buttons placement for better user experience. Please do it.', ""It cool that I now get to relive the old Gameloft games back when he's were simple, the most memorable one that I have always wanted to play again was zombie infection (hope that's the correct title), it felt like a 2D resident evil game, and I enjoyed every bit of it as a kid. The only gripe that I have with the classics is the controls and the smalll verticle screen but so far I love all of these games."", ""Quite disappointed. While there are indeed 30 games, most are trashy 'pop-culture' style ones, which weren't successful in their own right. There are a few decent ones, though. The biggest issue, is the UI, it's horrible! Only a fraction of the screen is used for the game itself, more than 3/4 is used for the 'shell', with basic yet unreliable controls. This is backwards, focus should be on EXTERNAL CONTROLLER SUPPORT. The only real positive is that the games can be played offline."", ""Simple and brilliant. 30 classic games each worth playing (I've played 4 so far) for different reasons. The whole thing runs very smoothly, looks great in a retro arcade style, and I've yet to encounter a single issue. No ads. No micro transactions. I'd like a donate button as this sort of model needs to be praised and rewarded! Everyone should have this on their phone."", ""So far, this is one of the best game on play store. It runs smoothly without any bug or other issue. Most importantly it contains 0 ads and absolutely free to play without any kind of microtransactions. The controls are fine. The user interface (UI) is quite simplistic. The game itself has 30 retro gameloft game to choose from, which is more than enough for an anniversary game. My only complain is that I would've love if the screen was a little bit bigger and if it's in landscape mode."", ""A cool nostalgia trip for sure. I definitely enjoyed revisiting the neat little games that I used to play on my old ericsson between classes in middle school. I originally intended to give this collection a higher rating, however. The major problem for me were the controls. The d-pad reacts sloppily and the fact that I can't re-map any buttons just made me wish I was still playing on my old Sony phone. And I guess the rights ran out a long time ago, but I sure wish I could revisit ghost recon.☹"", ""This brings back the good memories of older mobile games. However the lack of controls and lack of graphics on some games are only my issues there. On the graphics, it's okay (i was expecting a high quality graphics based on Sony Ericcson phones) On the controls, i would suggest that we need the diagonal directions such as 1, 3, 7 & 9 numpad buttons which is really lacking on action platform games such as Soul of Darkness, NOVA, Mortal Combat 2, etc."", ""I played Midnight Bowling for 9 hours straight and finish the game because since it is just like an emulator I thought it doesn't save progress. But I was wrong and still I finished it anyways. I had a really fun playing without those intrusive ads and nostalgic games in there. Hope there's more classic games. One thing I want to be added to game is to select games that I want only and remove the rest so that I can have more space."", ""The games are great. I mainly installed this app to play Diamond Rush which I'm glad to see after looking for it for years because I couldn't remember its name. It's just that the d-pad is very close to the abxy pad. When i want to go right, I'm accidently hitting the 'x' that makes me retry at the last checkpoint I passed with the cost of a life. It's very frustrating because I'll really need them later to survive the harder levels yet I'm losing them so easily. Please fix this. Thank you."", ""It's very nice from Gameloft to bring their classic games to Android. However, they should've put more effort into making the controls better. Currently they're very annoying to use and sometimes clicking a single button will register it twice. Also there's no controller support which would've been a great addition and a better replacement for the terrible on screen controls."", ""I would have given this game as much as 5 stars, but, sadly Gameloft didn't hit the home run players would be looking for. I think the controls should be enhanced, maybe much more aligned with the old Nokia phones (or at least make it an option in the settings). Also, if the screen could be adjusted, maybe to fit the top part of my screen, would be nice, because the screen size right now is really small (and very annoying). Also, I had a bug in Diamond Rush that wouldn't let the music play."", ""Enjoying this game collection, even there are some games that are not to my taste. I'm hoping that you can update this app to allow Bluetooth Controller support (and fix/add different on-screen joypad styles), as well as add a few more games. My favorites, so far, include Zombie Infection, Bubble Bash 2, and Alien Quarantine. Don't forget, folks, that you can play in Landscape mode by simply rotating your mobile screen horizontally."", ""It was nice to see those oldies again and it's a really nice move from you to give us all this in one app. I had a lot of trouble with the controls though and the screen could be bigger... I tried turning to landscape, but screen is still too small. Also when trying to write an actual keyboard would be much more convenient"", ""I like everything about this game! Every game is worth playing though i have a problem, i got annoyed because the vibration won't turn off and also can you make the controls more customizable because for some reason block breaker is pretty hard to play because of the controls, it would be great if it was customizable.

But, because each building needs so much stuff, with 16 slots you can only help 2 and a half buildings! You have 4 different types to make construction, food, tech, and a salon, yet each building needs the same things at each level so you end up using only 1 or 2 of the 4 types that make things and the other 2 are rarely used. Some things take 20 minutes to make 1 at a time, you make little money, and ALMOST ALL OF THE DECO ARE SPORTS! AND GETTING THE POOL IS UNKNOWN!!"", 'The app is fun and is designed to play with out purchasing. However if you do actually want to purchase anything you won\'t receive the product. There is no direct contact to create a ticket with out going through several avenues to find an email which turns out to be the one that doesn\'t resolve the issue. An automated response come back via email with a series of ""frequently asked questions"" none of which resolves the issue. You\'ll enjoy playing, DO NOT buy anything. I am out 2.99. Bummer.', ""Great before. Buggy now. Not sure why this occur. The stadium now causes my game to crash everytime. Also sometimes the game doesn't pick up my finger movement, and my phone works fine with other apps. Something is clearly wrong with the touch input. It came to a point that I can't complete any task because the game doesn't sense my finger properly."", ""I've Played for Years. All of a sudden it's very buggy. the controls aren't working properly. when I attempt to swipe items into the buildings it deselects selects other random things. I will revise my review and rating once this glitch has been resolved I've played for years and spent a lot of money with this game so I'd hate to uninstall and walk away but will have no other choice if you cant do jack due to malfunctioning."", ""The only reason I made it so low is so someone will notice. I absolutely love this game, but after I turned in some materials to get passports, the game started getting wonky. It won't let me turn in anything even though I have enough materials to complete an initiative. My XP bar is also acting up. One second it's showing a huge number over the amount it should have, and then other times its wayyyyy in the negatives. Developers- PLEASE FIX THIS!!! I really like this game and have gotten far."", ""Would be more fun if it didn't take HOURS to make enough of a product to upgrade anything. It's to the point I play 10 minutes then wait 30 to 45 min for something to finish just to use that to make something else that will take 45 minutes to make 1 when you need 5 to upgrade. Stupid unless you pay $$$$$ then you can buy items."", ""A very fun and addictive game. It's okay butthere are a few things that are really starting to annoy me about it like the fact that I watch ad videos without getting the reward for it, the fact that if I leave my internet connection on, all kinds of ads interrupt the game while am playing and also the fact that I can't access the stadium in my city among other things"", ""Still in early levels but, so far I'm enjoying it. I've been looking for something similar to SimCity build it and this game is about the closest I've found. Comparably there seems to be more things to do than alot of the other building type games that I've tried. However, I'm hoping it will start to get more challenging as I level up, other wise it will quickly become to repetative."", ""I loved the game up until I reached level 23. Now my experience points are a continuing rolling of numbers never stopping. I have the materials for certain properties but when I try to drop them in it gives me a missing report but it doesn't have anything listed as missing so now my inventory is just piling up because the things I make are not being accepted. it was a 5 star game until now"", ""Fun, good graphics addictive. It takes a long time to earn money. Would be better if you could receive money faster. But it n the most part fun game wish the build time on buildings was faster. Hopefully they may make it so it will speed up but , that an money earning are my main to things, an time on making things at the supply shop an factory could be faster. Please fix those. Would be alot better. I like docking the boats wish you didn't have to wait so long on them also. But it's a fun game."", 'I thought this game was going to be a cash grab. I was wrong. This is the most ingenious thing ever. Instead of pay to advance by force, you can watch ads from sponsors (which pays the devs) and in return, you get tasks completed or near completed. Also, you get in game currency. Again, perfect setup.', ""Uhh, the game was fun to play in everyway, it's addictive and everything. But ughhh..I'm literally mad right now. The game just stuck at some point where it askes me to increase the storage space of resources for free, and then when i click the plus sign to increase the game just completely stopped, doesn't work even if i closed and restarted it. I really wish if i could continue playing it😩..please try to fix these"", ""I really like this game. I literally spent hours looking for it because I'd once played it years back and enjoyed it. It ran fine for the first few levels, then the problems started. A game that once brought me joy became the bane of my existence. It started with little things like closing against my will, I'd initially blamed it on human error, maybe my fingers slipped, but it just happened way too often. Orders stopped getting processed... I'd continue but I've reached the word limit."", ""This game is kinda okay,but it's 60% horrible,the time spent in waiting for product to be done is too long and it's really challenging to advance to another level without spending real cash, I've deleted and re- downloaded the game several times and it's just so frustrating how the developers have refused to improve the game and address our complaints"", ""I don't think so but, no problem in terms of the whole gameplay. I can see there are lots of different buildings and infrastructures. However, if i am not wrong, you have missed one important facilities, college, universities and or any academic buildings. I just want to play the game seeing it like im basing it to absolute reality. Thank you!"", ""It's a good time-killer game and I played it for almost a month already. However when I reached level 20, everytime I click on the stadium, the app suddenly crashes and closes on its own. And now when I reached level 21, I can't even open the app anymore. It keeps crashing. I thought it just needed an update but so far I have the latest update of this app and nothing is still working. I spent a lot of time and effort for this and it would be a waste if I just uninstall this. Please fix this soon!"", ""Having a great time playing the game. Just wished for 2 things: the option to toggle the traffic and pedestrians off; and that using diamonds to skip timers ahead unwillingly wasn't so easy. Besides that, still my fav mobile game. 3rd wish: the option to sell unnecessary blueprints, since all landmarks have been built."", ""Pros: It's small in size if you've got little space, graphics are okay, music isn't blaringly loud or annoying like many games. Cons: Put a ring in your nose and be prepared to be led from objective to objective. Micro resource management intensive, even minor items like fruit. Too much demand for resources to do even minor upgrades. Apart from choosing placement of buildings you've got very little control. Ads of boy the ads are annoying, click in a building and an ad pops up."", ""I love this game, but there is something not right. all the building I made cannot rotate and I built a basketball court and picnic park but no one want to go there. I more rather don't build those. These are the reason that makes this game seems not realistic. But what I love about this game is this game is offline because I've been finding an offline building game. And the map I play still have a lot of things to be discovered. I hope I could see any improvement later. :) (no bug report)"", ""The most advert-stuffed game I've ever played. Adverts pop up, full screen randomly during game. When you try to collect things, the collection bubble jumps away at the last moment leaving you clicking on an advert that just appeared EVERY TIME! The structure of the game is such that after just a few hours of play progress is basically at a standstill unless you want to pay for the premium in-game currency (quell surprise)."", ""The cost to play the game is too expensive.. everything requires gem(which if I had money I'd purchase). For a month now I haven't been able to open the app and I stopped recieving notifications from them.. it keeps closing on its own when I try to open it. I reached level 17 and alot of users have the same complain. I wanted to clear the storage and restart the application but I figured I'd lose all my progress work. Please fix this then I'd consider rating a 5 star."", ""The game worked well till I reached 7000 citizense. I tried to open it up 5 times but it didn't work so I'm going to install it again. No big deal to me :) I'm not the one who gives up that easy :D It's a great game otherwise :) Great grafics too So I give it 4 stars for now I can start over and over again because it is so many possibilities to build a sucessful city."", ""It was working perfectly until recently, when i finished the stadium mission. Everytime i start up the game, when it loads and the ad is about to popup, the game crashes and it closes. Everytime the same. I have to try maybe 50 times to start it up. I'm pretty sure its the ads, cuz when its about to popup, when that grey box with the (×) button shows up, it crashes."", ""So I don't know the hell is going on with this game, but I am really pissed off. Its actually one of the best city construction games I have played so far. I went so far. So after I switched phones, I downloaded the game back into my phone and then logged into my Facebook account to continue where I left but after I did, the app crashed. It crashed and keeps crashing whenever I try to play it. Please gameloft do something about it, I really like this game and I hope you fix this bug. Thanks!"", ""Okay, so I play the game, it's working fine, I reach level 24 and it start crashing, it doesn't even load anymore, am starting to think its on purpose because I have played alot of games from Gameloft and they all have the same problem. After progressing to an extent, the game crashes. It's quite frustrating really"", ""Just another city building game like most others. Don't get me wrong, I'm enjoying playing it, but I do have a few gripes. I've noticed that it takes longer to produce resources and more base resources to make better ones. Not sure why those would increase. The ADs are downright annoying. Perfectly placed to popup when your mid click so your forced into watching stuff, like doing the last 30s speed ups of resources. Off topic, I bought a bundle 24hrs ago and still haven't received it yet."", ""Dragon legend mania ad freezes and you have to close the game and re open it to continue. You loose your reward if this happens. Sometimes this add is the only one presented, then the ony option is to uninstall the game, reinstall it and start from the beginning. Shame as it's a nice game, although you do spend a lot of time watching gameloft game adds, so not for those in a hurry"", ""It was good at first but then it keeps crashing after I reach level 15. I have reset the game twice and on the second try I purchased something. I hope I can get my game data back it didn't save the data, too bad"", ""It's quick to play and requires a lot of patience to wait for the materials, but it's simplicity compensates for it. Also you don't need to pay for the roads, if you had to, it would be very annoying. On another side sometimes it buggs out and doesn't respond to the orders given by the touch screen."", 'I loved this game but it really lags so much. To make matters worse, it now crashes like crazy. It crashes everytime I tap the stadium. I changed phones but the issue persists. Please fix', ""Uninstalling for the 2nd time to see if reinstalling works. It was working fine until 2 days ago when it started crashing immediately after opening. Update Oct.19. Have to reinstall for the third time. Uninstalling yet again. Each time a different feature doesn't work. Update. Still have to uninstall every other day or more. More problems every day Uninstalled again and now it won't let me get anything from the cloud so months of work has disappeared and I'm at the beginning."", 'Game is good however, adverts are popping up in a way so you accidentally tap on them, even if you dont want to, time to make resources is gradually going up with your level ie. Basic resource is metal which when you start playing the game it takes 30 seconds to make, after 5-6 levels it suddenly jumps up to 45 seconds, which indicates that the creators want you to spend more time idling than playing...', 'At first the game keeps running well but when i reached level 17, the game is not opening anymore. Keeps closing itself. The issue first started anytime I click on my city stadium to complete the mission for the day and now, the app is not opening.', ""It is a nice game no doubt. But honestly you should reduce the time at the production and building stuff. I can't be spending minutes waiting for it to load. And also stop giving too much request from buildings at once. And why does the game closes after i tap on stadium? You guys hardly give landmark stuff. But can you guys lower the bar a little bit? I am at the verge of deleting the app. Fix the stadium issue!"", ""Advertisements are broken. X in screen corner wont close the video after its been watched. Went to upgrade storage for first time, and it wont open, so game is stuck with me bashing the + button to no avail. And for a game that come under the 'offline games' section, its funny how it crashes every time i lose internet connection."", ""The game is really good for long term play but is it necessary to have to put 43 totem stones to get another ship when my space is literally full? And yet someone else was asked for only 5 stones to get the next ship. I can't use my storage because you asked for 43! I'm losing important resources because of ships and the number of blueprints needed to unlock new lands is too high. I really like this game and I really wish you can reduce the standards!"", ""Games are supposed to remove your stress but games like this have way lot of tasks that gives you more stress. You don't control the city, they give you orders (bigger & bigger tasks) & you have to follow them which ruins the city planning part. Most of the games follows same strategy. Oh and by the way...very bad controls...not at all smooth...and bugs....you will find same complaints in other reviews."", ""Good time killer, but drains the battery fast. I've played earlier versions of it with no issue, both on this and on my older Android, but this time I came across a bug that stopped my progress completely (can't upgrade the storage for the first time when it first fills up)."", ""the game is awesome to play.

The storyline is super interesting and the reality is ... well ... realistic! It easily escalates you into higher levels and doesn't waste its time on giving you cakewalks. Would totally recommend. If you're looking for a game with adventure and warfare thats not brutal, this is the game. One slight tweak is the build times. The build times easily rise from 2 minutes to something like 2 days. But otherwise, this is a awesome game."", ""Total conquest is good as it is but there's problems. Once I've initiated an attack, when it is loading, ads pop up and it automatically returns to my home screen. Also after that happens, the resources that has been spent isn't coming back to the storage. All in all, the game was good but it's bad is the ads that has been popping and popping up. That's all thank you for reading this."", ""I like the game. Been playing for 3 years. I stop and return playing cause of long upgrade duration. It takes 24hrs for a lvl 7 upgrade of a resource building. Also, the pop up ads ruin the mood. If only they'd allow us to view video ads willingly in exchange for crows that'd be great. I like the whole concept of the game tho. Please hear us out devs."", 'I downloaded it many times but I end up uninstalling it. I know 7 years ago, this game was offline. I really loved it. Then now, it is online. I know this game deserve to use online connection but can you make options, 1 you can still play it while connections are turn off. 2 if you decide to play online, just turn on the connection. In offline, limited use of resources, plays, and other. In online, everything will reload and download the resources you have done in order to cope up in present.', 'Even thoughany people say total conquest is clash of clans like, my experience has been much different. Even though you build your own empire, it has its own unique art style to it, and it makes it enjoyable. I wish Gameloft would come back and add some more upgrade levels or something', 'This is an underrated game, i hope u develop and update some features on it. Like add some troops or upgrade the existing ones also to resources and the time of the upgrading of defences. The battle features and campaign. There are more things to develop and it will be more interesting and fun game. I look forward to its new update soon.', ""i love this game, but it changed a lot, ads and bugs all around,and even removes the offline option, this was supposed to be great and more fun, the online was good tho, but we can't interact with others? way back then, before the major update this game was better than coc but now you are just copying them."", ""Not bad👍🏼 for a Roman kind of game. But the game has too many & so much complains🤔🤔 like; you can't communicate with your legion members, the upgrade time is too long😴, when you get to the store & mistakenly touch something;it doesn't ask if u are Sure. The thing is immediately bought when u don't need it🤨. Again, during battle the server disconnect & this will cause you to lose a battle for nothing 😤 & it's also extremely difficult to get crown 👑. That's why;my 3 star⭐ is even too much."", ""This game is full of bugs and needs good graphics. First of all the graphic is little bit bad. Whenever I attack on conquest in the game it says 3 resilience points left to conquer the area but when I attack it says I haven't attack. Also after winning conquest they don't give you fu*&ing any reward. The game needs to be imrove and Gameloft you have to fix global chat etc. This game is going to die. Thank you🙏🙏🙏"", 'Very good game , this is a very addictive game and a great time killer because you will need to wait minutes or hours to upgrade, build and invade I highly recommend this game to add something like the food to be traded to coins something like that if you will add that then this game will be more good , and if you can you should reduce the time waiting for upgrade , train or build towers Ty developers!', ""It's amazing especially since you can play against other people and in case you delete the game don't think all hope is lost when u download it back u can login and then all your things will return back to normal even though it was strange that when you download the game it will still have to download"", ""Fix bug it always say unable to connect to the server. Why i cant attack or search my opponent for long not even so long after 2 mi it always say that. And make ambrosia more collectable. If possible add more troops and buildings. And now I cannot recover my previous I'd from FB always says it is under construction. You have no authorization."", 'Very interesting game, you can always prepare for a battle. Well, I wish the training time for Units be made shorter, because I often wait for so long to get the desired number of soldiers for a battle. Secondly, most times the game will redownload itself when I try to open it. However, I love the strategy. 😍', 'This game is one of the best i ever played, i rated it five5stars but i had to withdraw my rating to one1star. It stops working from time to time, i have uninstalled and installed it more than 5 times. This is upsetting ill download it one last time if iy fails you have lost a client in me', ""I have LOVED this game since I first put eyes on it. HOWEVER there are several things that it needs to improve. FIRST and foremost when I first played this game it had a good amount of updates(as normal games do have) HOWEVER it would oftentimes not let me update for a month or too. Though that was on a different device that this is no longer available on. SECONDLY, it has a pop up commercial EVERY 30 SECONDS and it's REDICULOUS!! Clash of clans doesn't have that and neither should this."", 'This game is good . I like it . It like clash of clans .. but it has some problems... Like .. when I search for an.. Enemy for attack ...

Wish others clan games would implement this feature into there games, but the fact that you have pop up ads every 30 seconds is why I give 5 stars. If you have in app purchases that people are buying then get rid of the pop up ads. Makes me not want to continue playing', ""Yo what the heck? I alwys love this game but now? it wqs offline before, made for us who can't afford wifi or load ,I mean it's not bad if you will put online updates but you should keep the offline mode flip it! And when in online, too many ads almost every 10 mins or every time I finish a fight. Server lag. You can put so many ads but can't fix lag? maybe the ads causes lag. Such a shame......"", ""It's addictive and very enjoyable. Unfortunately, the constantly popping ads from Gameloft are annoying and they don't make playing worthwhile. Hence, I can't seem find an option to block them. Please help!!"", 'The reason I am giving only 3 stars is because i often get disconnected from the server even though I have a good internet connection . Its really irritating because if you get disconnected during a battle the reward and the points will be lost even if the battle is on the verge of victory. I hope the developer look towards this issue. Please i already lost many matches because of this.', ""Wonderful Strategy Game♥ This game remind me of “Age of Empires” & “Age of Mythology”. It's totally different game in current time. I like this game very much, everything is fine & okay except the “Chat” option not working and its taking too much time to find/searching for opponent. I hope so soon new update will come with full details of Legion/Profile/Troops details and add friend request in all profile. And if there any suggestions shows of building update on architect panel that will be gd."", ""It fails to download. I open the app and I've tried more than 20 times but it gets to 120mb downloaded then it fails and my internet connection is fine.

When i open the app it downloads all the way to 120mb then fails please help me I have no idea what to do I have cleared the cache and reinstalled the game nothing is working!"", ""This game is one of my personal favorites. It's so addictive! I dont enjoy how much time you have to wait for things to be built though. I do battles while I wait but then I win and have lots I dont even use because all my architects are busy. Super fun though and I recomend it ro people who enjoy this sort of stuff (and are patient) :D Ps: FIX THE GOD DAMN ADS! THEY ARE EXTREMELY ANNOYING Also plz ad more troops to barracks of the gods and fix the chat"", ""Good game, but...getting extra builder is a heardship. Upgrading buildings are also expensive and takes ages to complete..most of the time I'm not playing because it's stuck upgrading . Less the amount to upgrade and maybe will be better. Thanks"", 'The game is poorly made. Once there is a network break, a battle won would be recorded as a loss. It also reverses the countdown time on upgrades and troops training most of the time.', ""Cannot invite people on facebook, the function just doesn't work, after connecting with facebook my name was changed and now it can't be changed back unless I change my facebook name, only an idiot would consider this a good feature. Also the game crashes when trying to get revenge on a player. Don't install this game."", ""I used remember the old version of this game, being offline, fun, lots Adventure, can be shared with others, strategic and I even cheated it, much more cooler than COC really, now it's online and the worse thing is I can't even play the game because you must have a working internet connection so pls... Bring the old version back, the offline one and I will give 5 stars pls....."", 'I love this game, my problem is the control, sensibility and respond are quite slow and needed to be quicker, and why does it take too long to revive/regenarate heroes and so as clearing obstacles? 😁 But in all, this game deserves 5 star.', ""Honestly very fun game but the reason why I give this 3 what's in because the lack of updates and other things like not being able to talk on global and not being able to connect to social media if the creators of the total conquest came back and fixed up this game a little more and keep updating it and fixing all the problems in the game now this would honestly come head to head if not close to clash of clans, plz come back and fix up the game."", ""It was very interesting when I played last years. But last month something happens with conquest mode, it doesn't distribute equally. 10 players can be in one team, and only one in two other teams. And also rewards after finishing conquest disappeared"", ""Literally every time I use it ads pop up and it makes the game crash and it's so glitchy. If this didn't happen I would give it a much higher rating as I like the game but the ads completely ruin it. :("", 'To be honest my number 1 rules on life now is ""Don\'t Ever Trust Gameloft On Android Games!"", I hate to say this but the more times move Gameloft is getting worst and even the games showing it to us, I played this game back on 2015 and it was fine nothing really annoyed me a lot. It\'s 2020 and I changes a lot and contains a lot bugs and the game isn\'t letting play offline like the old day, I have to open my Wi-Fi and I have to wait like hours to play this awful game. Trash. 1 out 5. No more.', ""a super duper great game better than i had expected so i'm giving a second 5 star review in the hopes that the dev's will come back to working on this game and fixing some of the bugs because it's still playable but without working ads you can't get rewards and without a working chat system it can be hard to meet people and more but over all it's loads of fun even like this that's why i'm showing some love for it ....so come on gameloft get with it this epic title needs your support"", ""Almost all the game created by gameloft were good. I almost downloaded and playing all of gameloft games. But didn't fix the problems in it or maybe took it too long. I hope you'll be seing these and fix a lot of problems. Thank you!"", 'I completed all level & now all elements are updated maximum🙄 I want new level again to play more time this games. But still there are some major bug that not fixed at latest update. Such as- 1. Global chat & legion chat option not working 2. Legion invitation not working properly 3. Need more improve of graphics quality 4. Showing ads several time in every log 5. Need more level or a separate part in same game to enjoy & play more time because I already finished of all😅 Thanks Gameloft.', ""The game has so many bugs in it it doesn't want to load and when you seek revenge on the players that attacked you it doesn't load all your unit it only give you like three or four of them also when I purchased tokens it took my money and didn't give me any tokens I used to play it all the time when I first download it no I'm thinking of deleting it"", 'Good game, nice concept. I have been playing it for a long time. Fix the damn bugs. Sometimes I have already won a battle , but little network itch, it will declare that I lost the battle', ""It's a very good game but there are some issues for example when someone is attacking you and they get all your loot from villas and farms so what is the point of gold storage and food storage if they don't store your food and gold please fix that because it really frustrates me that's the reason I stopped playing it"", ""Hey, I love this game they are so cute when they attack and this game is cool. But please put the offline mode back like the old version of this everyone's talking about the offline mode. Thank You"", ""Why this new version can not log in into facebook, it's so sad i can't even save my progress, one more worse thing is this morning when I open the game it ask me to download some kine of resources data and at that time my internet was 4G but it failed to download, I tried several times but still fail.

Frustrating would be the right word. It doesn't seem to depend on skill at all. You basically play each level many multiples of times until enough boosters accumulate and points to buy extra moves (you can use them all and still not win). It's strictly a matter of chance most times. I considered quitting as it was new, but gave the devs more time. Uninstalled now."", 'Overall, I actually really like this game. It\'s fun to play and the storylines are cute. Unfortunately, there aren\'t enough updates. Instead of being able to move forward in the levels, we\'ve been getting stop-gap ""find the keys"" levels (I have tons of keys I can\'t use as everything available is unlocked, and many levels are repeats). The last update only gave us ten new levels. This is becoming really boring really fast.', ""LOVE this game! It's challenging and beautifully animated...but, it doesn't give a whole lot of coins for beating the tougher levels, or any level for that matter. Also, when you log in everyday, you get unlimited lives, but I've reached a point to where I have to wait for new levels, which doesn't help when my unlimited lives will run out before I get to play."", ""I've played since it was first released and was instantly hooked! Loved that it was challenging but not impossible to progress through the story. Since last update, levels are a lot harder. The option to watch ads for a few free coins is gone, so now you have to pay real money to actually get any help. Being stuck on the same level for days at a time is so frustrating, where as before you could get coins every once in a while to help pass a hard level."", 'This app is great! It is one of the best mobile games I have played. I can sit there for an hour playing when I have unlimited lives. I love how you are included in the story and can choose dialogue. I just wish you could customize the decorations. I took away a star because the game deleted at least five levels of my progress and set me back a quest, which really disappointed me.', ""The graphics are wonderful, the storylines seem to be good but the puzzles are too difficult to move with any speed. I am usually very good at match three but often i can only get one, maybe two puzzles for five lives. It is too expensive to buy things so it gets frustrating. I will try a few more times then I will uninstall because it takes the fun out of it. That's too bad because I do enjoy the game and would liked to move forward."", 'like others have said, after the first 30 levels or so it gets really hard. I play these types of games all the time and found it annoyingly hard. Even with booster some levels are stupid hard. The degree of difficulty doesnt feel appropriate for the audience. The story moves slow and you pay lots of hard earned stars to just advance the story a tiny bit.', ""This game is fun until you reach a certain level then it becomes near impossible to beat any level without boosters in which you have to earn or spend real money on. If you decide to continue playing you have to spend alot of coins which are real hard to earn.The game freezes alot and you lose any powerups you chose whether you use them or not. There is also Pop Up ads. And oh yea the Princesses give you a real nasty look if you lose or restart a level. So that's always nice :)"", ""this game is terrible I got to level 70 once I was tired I exited out of the game when I went to play a few hours later it started me all the way from level 1 I'm not able to save any of my previous levels and it has happened to me four different times.... The game is cool but I do not like the bugs need to fix as soon as possible and the game would be good also make it possible to be able to save previous levels if these problems can be fixed I would rate five stars."", 'I mostly enjoy the game. Some things I dont like tho are: if you are lucky enough to get free play, it\'s only 15 minutes. And then you have to keep clicking out of all the popups for the game to play the 10 minutes you have left. Some of these levels are ridiculously hard, and way not enough moves. Seriously. Also, it takes way too long to accumulate stars to progress and way too many stars for the ""projects"".', ""Theme is nice and the story is engaging, if slow to be released, but the algorithms are just a little too tight. There are levels (yes, plural!) where you wait days for the A.I. to issue the 2 rainbow+other powerup combinations (yeah, one lucky combo is not enough) that are necessary to beat the level. Steer clear of buying powerups; after saving a bunch and testing their usefulness on difficult levels, I've concluded that they are a red herring."", ""The game is enjoyable and the graphics are awesome, however, as early as the mid 30 levels, you start needing boosters. I'm a moderately experienced match 3 player, so I'm sure it's harder for beginners. It takes away from the fun of the game, people just become frustrated, uninstall the game, then everyone loses in the end."", 'As a guy, if you can look past the game revolving around Disney Princesses, this is arguably the best match 3/design game available in the Google Play Store. (And Ive tried most of them) So far the difficulty is just right and the graphics are vivid and crisp. Being able to choose portions of the story is a nice surprise as well. I hope the developers keep, well, developing.', 'Graphics are decent, and the storyline is engaging thus far. I am at level 47 and have not lost a round yet, but the levels in this gem burst game are getting a little difficult. One does not need to score a lot of rounds before yhe other princeses are in play. No need to watch a lot of adds to play. Watching adds are user self-enflicted. A promising game thus far.', ""Love it, but miss new levels. I had tried other similar games, and this is the first I've thoroughly enjoyed since Sailor Moon Drops was shut down. It has in curiosity sparking storyline with beloved princesses, and the graphics are cute and nostalgic. The gameplay is fun and challenging. While I appreciate the mini challenges available while awaiting new levels, they're feeling very repetitive after months of waiting. I miss the main game and feel I will never get to know the rest of the plot"", ""You have to beat 18 levels just to build a pillar! Its absolutely ridiculous, not to mention how hard it is! I've played the same level over 50 times to no avail! & I refuse to spend $$ to buy in game power ups, if I cant earn them PLAYING I will go without... which means I can't win no matter how many times I try! And now the latest glitch BS, I haven't even played in over a week because every time the game opens, I click on the play button and the game immediately crashes and closes! 🤬🤬🤬"", ""It's fun, but I've already completed every single level and haven't been able to collect stars to finish the last several missions. Not sure why I was forced to collect chest keys instead? Even if I could just replay levels I've already played it would be nice as now I can't play it at all for another 18 hours until the update which is annoying. I agree with others that some of the levels are just stupidly hard. I have managed to beat every one without spending any money, but it's still crazy."", ""This game screams little girls. However, not for little girls! Not for adults unless you like to do the same level a million times. I've been playing for my daughter so she can fix up the princesses homes. We have all decided it is to difficult and it shouldn't be. We have now deleted it and will not be getting it again. The only way to beat the levels with out playing each multiple, and I mean multiple! Is to pay for move moves or cheats."", ""It was pretty fun till about level 48. They give you special items to use, which I had been saving for the higher levels. All 3 times I used them, the game froze and so I lost the items along with the level. Sorta lost interest after that so I'm uninstalling. If your game doesn't glitch then I'm sure you'll enjoy it more than I did."", 'Day 2 - Well done so far. Very cute game. Update - I am now at level 262. I\'m removing 2 star because they ""added new levels"" but I\'m finding that a shockingly large number of new levels are simply recycled from earlier levels. Seems to be too early in the life cycle for that nonsense. It\'s really annoying', 'It\'s very addictive. The animation is very good, the puzzles are the right difficulty, and the story so far is very good. Editing: I am getting tired after each level where the game will tell me to check out the other princesses, not give me the option to ""x"" out.', ""This is a really good game, I'd like to stay on it longer though. Difficulty is a bit too high. Boosters can be hard to activate with double tap. Graphics are excellent and creativity on the game play is exceptional. I havent seen anything like the bows or perfume vials on other match 3 games. Great job!!"", 'The overall appearance is terrific, but gameplay is slowed down way too much by 1) the little cut scenes, which you can\'t skip right away, and by 2) the sluggish match-3 animation. Furthermore, the ""plots"" for Jasmine and Belle involve being trapped in the area you\'re renovating while, respectively, Aladdin goes outside to fetch things and Beast takes forever to show up...', 'Love the overall style and content of the game. I like being able to help out the princesses and having that bit of game within the game. However, it gets difficult fast. I am constantly stuck on the same levels for days at a time. Not the most relaxing game when you dont want to think.', ""I just started playing this, but I was waiting a long time for it to became available, and so far, it has not let me down. The opening animation of Ariel, Belle, and Jasmine is gorgeous! It feels like I'm really visiting them in their castles. Even though it's mainly a match 3 game, it does have a story as well. Edit: I dropped a star from my review because the game deletes my treasure from the final optional key quest the next day every time I beat it. I feel cheated."", ""I've really enjoyed this game a lot so much that I'm stuck at level 631 and now have to wait for a new update to come out for more levels. I think that if there are quests to do there should be levels to do them. I have been waiting for at least 2 wks for more levels. If I don't get more soon i will delete the game no need for it to take up space on my phone if I can't play it."", ""As a libertarian and a Disney fan. I usually support Disney. But this game is just wrong. Yes you can play for free, but don't except to advance through the game easily. And if I have difficulty progressing I can't imagine how the small children this game is aimed at manage. In addition to necessary in app purchases, there are adds. This is an obvious cash grab."", 'Beautiful graphics. Levels are easy but not always a walk in the park. Just challenging enough to not be borderline impossible like some other match 3 games. I appreciate that because being stuck on the same level for days or sometimes even weeks completely takes away from the enjoyment of playing it.', ""Super cute game, I wish I could give a better description but it's only allowing me to write in the heading spot. I initially downloaded this app for my daughter because she loves Disney princesses. After playing the 1st few boards I was hooked. I love the story line and being able to pick which way the story goes. My only complaint is the mount of stars tht is needed to move forward., also the lack of coins given at the end. Work on that and the game is perfect."", ""Why is there an ad when I open the app? I do not like that. Usually with Gameloft games the only way you see an ad is if you choose to watch an ad for free coins. I'm okay with that. But if an ad pops up when I don't want it to, I will not like this app. It's disney too, it should be good enough to where you don't get an ad every 5 minutes. Please fix this bug, or I will uninstall, it's getting boring."", ""I've been playing for about two hours, maybe more. I did finish helping Jasmine, already, going to work on helping Belle next. Some animations are a bit glitchy looking in certain scenes. Other than that I love it and I am enjoying myself. I love the decision making part, adds a different element to the typical 3 match game. Thanks for making an awesome Disney game!"", 'If you combine a bomb or arrow and it hits another one right next to a desired target and it hits the target twice within the same hit it only counts as 1 hit, same thing if you combine a rainbow top with butterfly and it hits the same target more than once it counts as 1 hit... Game sometimes freezes so then you need to exit which then you lose a life... Ad pop ups during game play annoying...', ""This game has so many great features which should make it worth 5 stars, but the down side is that some of the levels are near impossible. For example, I'm at the point now where I've played enough days consecutively that the daily reward gives me 30 minutes of unlimited lives, and yet for 3 days I have been stuck on the same level. I must have played the level over 100 times, I've wasted over a dozen boosters trying to get past it, and spent all my gold on extra turns. It's not fun anymore."", ""The game is not too easy not too hard, I really enjoy having access to 30 minutes of unlimited lives each day. However every few levels the game crashes and it can be frustrating if I'm about to complete a more difficult level. I will change back my rating once it gets fixed. Finally managed to get to 204, but cannot go any further in the storyline even though Ariel's throne room isn't complete."", ""Very fun game and not so hard like many others are saying you don't need to spend money to progress through the game. Would have given 5 stars if I didn't have to start collecting keys and have to wait 18 days to play again. Even if there are no new levels, we should be able to replay old levels. The princesses stories are quite boring too. Would be good if you could easily spend all your keys without having to wait and then press skip."", 'Good game in theory. Ive been stuck on level 65 for a while now and cant get past it. The levels get really hard and the only way to pass them is to spend real money which i dont want to do. Could be a good game but you need stars to unlock the part you need and you get 1 star per game. So annoying and takes forever. Also rather than have the same game for all the characters there should be an option to do other ones for each character. Could be better than what it is.', ""I absolutely love this game and would have given it 5/5 if there hadn't been any issues. I noticed that for a while, the daily gifts had stopped showing up which I just thought would fixed with this new update. It was not fixed. Also with the new update, it says to tap the screen to decorate but I can no longer tap the screen. I know it's not my phone because everything else on it works. I can't tap anything on the game. I hope this gets fixed because I would love to keep the level I'm at now"", 'This game is well developed, and very fun to play! I also love that it incorporates the Disney Princesses into the gameplay. The graphics are great, the music is wonderful, and the in-game elements are marvelously creative. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who has a liking for the Disney Princesses.', ""This game is very cool especially if you're into match 3 and enjoy a light Disney story. The grafic is really nice and the game responds really well to commands... No endless waiting time to load levels. Level of difficulty is ok and It keeped me engaged with both the story and the quests. I really enjoyed it and I can hardly wait to see what's going to happen next."", ""I really want to give a better review, but the problem with this game is that, despite its cute animation and slightly more unique gameplay for a matching game, the levels increase in difficulty at a ridiculous rate. I've only just reached level 68, after four days of regular playing - often taking 10-15 tries per level. I realise it's because the devs want players to fork out cash for boosters. I say boo to the devs. If you want the player base to remain faithful, set realistic levels.""]",False,"['com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDYHM', 'com.disney.frozensaga_goo', 'com.jamcity.blackforest_goo', 'com.perblue.disneyheroes', 'com.bandagames.mpuzzle.gp']","['com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA9HM', 'com.gameloft.anmp.sniper.champions', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDMHM', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA8HM', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDOHM']",com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDPMF,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDPMF&hl=en&gl=us

Update, since I put it on my Chromebook, it continues to crash. I was able to play for a while and then the game closed. I start it from either the app or from the playstore and it acts as though it wants to start then it crashes. Also, I wanted to mention that I have completed all of the acts and it would be nice to have more than the 1 chapter in Act 4. One more thing, my Sun Wukong is missing. Her was taken from me somehow. I didn't sell him either."", '5 star for me ! It should of been a 4 because theres a few bugs and crashes, but if that dosent get to you then its alot of fun! Once the fun stops the playing stops ultimately. If its to hard to grow your team it becomes discouraging. Just wish we could get some update of some kind. It took a bit of grinding but im just now starting to have fun again. Only thing that erks me is im always closing and restarting the app! My message bar never appears. Good deals thoe so dont be afraid to spend $.', ""Games alright. However for literally no explainable reason there is a part of the screen I am randomly unable to access, meaning it doesn't register me touching the screen. It's a new phone and I have no issues with other apps, I notice it goes away after a reinstall but I do not feel like uninstalling and reinstalling whenever it happens. It causes me to lose access to share sphere function as well as a few other features. Fix this. Also why is nectar so difficult to aquire? Blue specifically"", ""It's a good fighting game with decent designs for the characters.not the best I've seen, but still one you should at least try out, if not for two things. 1) it's buggy. It will lag and buffer a bit, especially at really inopportune times, like when either you or your opponent make an attack. Also, after about a month of playing, it simply crashes whenever you open the app. 2) it's not being supported. The last update was the first blip of life in years, and nothing since. No new anything."", ""It is a great game and entertaining at times however, I cannot even describe the amount of bugs and glitches there are going on in the game. Sometimes it's just disappointing and annoying to play because the bugs and glitches. Half the time my character is unresponsive while other times I can't even block. Also when achieving an adventure sometimes it just gives me an error and I have to restart the app and then I just lose whatever victory I had won or my prizes change completely. Etc etc..."", 'I absolutely love this game, the reason for the 3 star rating is because about every 5-10 battles, my game will get stuck on loading, and I have to close and reopen the app, which is quite frustrating, and when I reopen it, it sometimes takes 3 tries until it loads again. Please help fix this issue! I love this game!', 'I decided to come back to playing this game after not playing for awhile. The graphics are still amazing, but the combat ""tap"" controls still need to be worked on. My computer controlled opponent has no problem attacking me, but I sometimes have trouble attacking back. I will still keep on playing because of the new characters.', ""The game used to be great. Gameloft has dropped the ball on this one. No updates except for fighters you cant get unless you buy and they took away the special spheres that made you want to buy, I've had the same fighters forever, cant upgrade because you have to play it all day, everyday, to get one and who has that kind of time? I love to play it though it gets boring with no new fighters, the gameplay and controls are excellent. The game crashes alot but no fixes. SPECIAL SPHERES, GENTLEMEN! worth playing, but no chance of getting new fighters unless you have all day to play or want to pay."", ""I enjoy it, I wish unlocking the characters and the spheres (this games version of loot crates) were a bit less of a waste all around for the most part, but besides that it's not bad. simple controls, sometimes get a little buggy but nothing major except in pvp. not the greatest fighting game, but if you're looking for something that easy to get into and manage, that has a fairly decent character building system, this is the way to go. wont give full 5 stars because all fights become the same"", ""I've played once before but the game was a little too heavy for my device and I couldn't get the full experience which I'm thoroughly enjoying now! Graphics are killer, game play is killer and there seems to be a ton of events to distract from just fighting. I just started so we'll see if the bottom drops out or it's a 5* winner. So far so good."", 'This game is absolutely one of the best and there is not to many to begin with but this one is top three for myself. Easy control of characters, awesome rewards. Even better no commercials. To the developers the whole team behind the scenes, Awesome job, Awesome game play, I would like to thank you on a job very well done. and finally developing a RPG to rival FF. That being said Thank you!', ""This game is aeesome from the graphics to game play mechanics. Except the game tends to close unexpectedly. I can be in the middle of an event when suddenly the screen will freeze and I'm redirected to my home screen. If this isn't fixed soon then I'll be forced to delete the game entirely."", ""Had the game a few years ago and loved it. Redownloaded it and lost my save. I'd give it 3 stars because it's that good of a game but it wont stay open for more than 10 minutes without crashing. I cant even play a full battle without it crashing. How am I supposed to play a game if I cant play the game? Terrible"", 'Initially I enjoyed the game. The battles were epic and fair. But it became obvious to me after climbing just a few levels that I wasn\'t going any further without spending some money (which I didn\'t have at the time). It says that if you\'re ""lucky"" you can win 4 star fighters. It isn\'t luck every spin is computer generated and controlled and it is programed to get you to spend. I decided to go as far as I could, but even after winning many battles/many ""orbs"" not one 4 star champion.', 'Game is good, fights are intense and graphics are excellent. Generally, I don\'t like the ""tapping and swiping"" system, but, despite some lags, one can be used to it... But the one reason they don\'t deserve 5 stars is the ""Rank up"" system, which keeps you on the same level forever if you\'re not lucky enough to get the items you need on the right time. The Events where they release them just close (new ones open) when time\'s over and that\'s it... You\'ll NEVER get the chance to get them otherwise.', ""I was looking for an alternative to Marvel contest of champions and found this, with similar controls. There are many great things about the game...but also issues. Pros: awesome visuals! The heroes and scenes are incredibly detailed. The concept is developed in a beautiful and coherent way. Cons: controls are not fluid. Difficult to create combos. Evade and dash are not reliable. This makes the action limited to attack, block, loops ... repetitive with no real player's skills involved."", ""the experience is amazing. the graphics are dope, the moves are dope. you dont need to use real money to go through the game. has many stages so it doesn't finish early. There is also always a level you can beat. it's never too difficult or too easy. The only problem I have is that, there are too many network connectivity errors. and that disturbs the play, and I can view the Oracle's ads to get rewards when using mobile data. Otherwise the game is amazing."", 'Game glitches at least once a week. Difficult to deal a heavy attack unless it is a special. Controls are so-so and not smooth. No more additional characters just variants. Seriously? There are a lot of cultures in this planet. The title should have been changed to a different one so we can see a variety of gods/demigods/ancients/monsters/heroes. This game has potential, it has not been tapped into yet.', ""I don't usually play the same game for a long time unlike this one, 'cause I like switching to new ones and so. But I've been playing it for over a month and I really loved the concept and and the over all graphics and stuff. But the reason for 4 stars is because the controls. They are simple but there are many times, the characters won't respond to the swiping or tapping. Also it started crashing recently. Everytime I play it, it crashes atleast once within a 15 to 40 minutes time gap."", ""I played this game a long time ago on Windows phone and I liked it then... Was ready to start over but the storage doesn't work ! Most events reward just vanish, so I can't claim nectar and such and cannot progress, what the hell?? Same issue with sphere shards, I could claim several but the menu is not accessible. I remember a somewhat grindy but enjoyable game, not so much if progression is crippled by bugs."", ""This game was perfect in 2015 until this year in 2022. This game kicks me out more often whenever I try to fight an opponent or even try to get in(sometimes). Also, iirc, 3 characters are coming soon. These 3 characters have been there since 2017 and yet they still haven't been revealed. Pls, update the game & make sure this game doesn't kick anyone out whenever a player plays this game. Thank you!"", ""This is about updates...I have been playing this game, since it's release. I used to be very excited whenever the game releases new updates but now it has been more than an year since it got any updates. In the collections tab, I am fascinated to see all the cool new fighters like, light massinissa, dark artemis etc. But I can't find a way to gain them. No events no spheres. Apart from that, even the minor problems like crashes, bags, and lags are a separate issue"", ""I would love to give it 5 stars, but the app suddenly shuts down in between fights & I've lost some bonuses as a result. 4 stars is pushing it, but yes apart from the irritating shut-downs, I thoroughly enjoyed this game back in 2016, & a few days in 2018 & now, in 2020. It has helped me deal with excess time & channelize my aggression into another place, & restored my peace of mind."", ""Good game, I'd love to give 5 stars but I changed my mind. I like it that I've been playing it for whole 4 hrs. However, after reaching level 10, the game became lagging & always showing error everytime I tried to open spheres or after finish the fight. Need to fix asap! Cannot wait for the update of the bug fix, please. Onegaisimas!"", ""I've been playing it for a couple of days now, and there are several bugs, as described here in many reviews. Problems with unresponsive controls, rewards not received and the odds for the spheres.. The graphics are really good, though! I hope it improves.."", ""The game is cool and has alot of characters. Also they have unique powers and fighting abilities. The graphics is also impressive. However, the adventure mode doesn't work. Tried several times and it doesn't load. Pls developer let that be addressed."", 'The game is really fun but there is a major problem with it. For some reason, whenever I open a sphere that gives me ichor to upgrade my fighters and I press ""upgrade fighter"", I look in my inventory and I only get the rank up items. PLEASE fix this! Also, the game\' sound is there for about 10 minutes then it stops playing all together.', '40% unplayable. Keeps getting error msgs or claims there is no internet connection where as i am able to switch to other apps with no connectivity issues. Loading takes too long. Crashes often especially after upgrading a charactet. Fix your servers man and update this game pls. FF sake!', ""Love this game been playing on and off for 5 years. I would give 5 stars but there are some bugs that need sorting. I'm owed gems and contacted customer service and haven't heard back. Game keeps kicking me out especially when I'm trying to collect my adventure rewards then I sign back in and get a different result and less prizes. controls don't respond properly when I'm trying to block and use my ultra. Pleas fix as I love this game. Also we should be able to trade within our alliances"", ""I'm Seriously confused, I downloaded and played this game back when it first came out on an old Samsung galaxy edge everything looked perfect and now I tried to play on a new phone I got in 2022 and it's buggy and the characters completely glitch out. What's going on?? My phone is new. Is this game just too old 🤔?? Fix it, update everything and get with the times we're too advanced in technology to be having these kind of issues in games."", ""The game is full of bugs. I have been trying to upgrade a 4 star Medusa all morning and it won't give me the items, all though they are marked as given. When I try to rankup they are missing. Also I can't open the sharded spheres. When I press the button, it does nothing."", 'Ok the slide or tap fight move gets a little Boring, why not slide down/up left right, to create diff type of heavy hitting and tapping still rapid low power attacks. I believe this is where the games ""power points"" should set you apart from other games', 'Buggy but it can be tedious. Depending on your style of play and things you do more then others, or do cetain things 1st before others , etc i. e. Style of play. It dictates what kind of offers you get and pop up ones. I enjoy the game its just im at the point to where no matter how hard i grind in pvp getting those 4* characters always seem just out of fingers reach. Outside the negative , positive is after joining a alliance i now got friends from all over the world. Too cool', ""I'm changeing my previous review score from 3 to 1 star, because of the ever-present crashes and because of multiple problems i've encountered during my gameplay. Aside from constant crashes the game suffers from a multitude of bugs, errors and glitches, and to name a few, you, sometimes, can't switch between spheres and shard spheres in the temple. You have to restart the game to access them, also another problem I found is an error that pops up when you try to finish an action."", ""Nice update ad great graphics but it always glitches for a while playing the game. Need a new interface of the characters selection, vs, etc. Make it possible for people to invite other players to join our league. Make league war available and league vs leagues available too. Please you guys should change the name of this game because it doesn't look like God's of Rome any more, it has different characters that are not from Rome. So you guys should add more characters. Thanks for updating it."", 'Great game until bug. I have a galaxy tab S7 and nothing wrong with the sound for other apps but there is no sound for this game. It had sound in the start and then it just stopped. There is no sound at all.', 'Game just gets boring... And it is frustrating to have to go to the same paths just to finish any events...And The special powers on some characters are the same as the regular power.... JUST BORING.. 🤢🤮', ""Graphics glitches, body's are not loading properly as well it for some reason made me start over with a new profile. So I'm aggregated that all my progress is gone or what what ever happend and nothing back from developers on fixing it. I spent money to get thing rolling and enjoy my self and now poof!!!"", 'Great and addicting game! it has a nice graphics, love the details in the characters and the ui is easy to understand. The downside is every 10 mins the game always crashed. i have lots of memory and storage on my phone still it crashed. hoping that the dev would fix this issue soon...', ""This is one of the best games i have played so far. Nice graphics, mind blowing actions, incredible levels and lots more. I'll say the game is addictive and trust me you'll like the game. I wish I could give you guys more than five 🌟 if possible.

Buck Crosshaw never shot a man dead who didn’t deserve it, but now he’s an outlaw who had to fake his own death and escape to Arizona to seek redemption. But in escaping one evil, Buck is about to face another, for an ancient and wicked force stirs in the hills of this mysterious region.

You’ll travel the path of a wanted man, dead set on redemption, as you become completely immersed in the story and red hot action. But don’t be fooled by this land’s beauty -- outlaws, the living dead, and many other unnatural foes lurk behind every shadow.

Take on 40 missions with a great variety of tasks for you to overcome. You’ll race horses, take out robbers, fend off waves of enemies (living and dead), and much more along the way.

In this kill-or-be-killed land, you’ll ride free on 8 different horses while unlocking 19 weapons and a wide selection of clothes, ammo and other gear to help you on your adventure of redemption.

If you think a game this deep or fun has to cost you, you’re dead wrong! No real money redemption is needed to download and play this game to the end.

I mean sure the controls are there, but it's getting them to function right is the problem. The moving around to walk or ride is mostly what I'm having issues with. The shooting isn't bad but when your riding on horseback you can't really aim. And if there are men on the roof you can't see them if you don't know they're there. The first level was fine but afterwards it's just disappointing."", 'not as great as other gameloft titles. too much needed to pay-to-even-play with all the side jobs and tasks. the game would be great if there were a nice way to start out like Gangstar Vegas. (at the least that game gives one a chance with decent inventory control). this game cannot be played without watching ads. some games you choose to watch ads, this one...you have to unless you\'re gonna pay up front for items just to ""get by"" in the infancy levels.', ""Fun immersive game, one of my favorite mobile games. But recently my game started crashing before the app even gets to the loading screen. When I press on the app icon it shows a black blank screen for about a second then closes. I haven't been able to resolve this through cleaning out my phone or clearing storage. Maybe it's a bug, but either way would really like to get back to playing it again as I've made a few purchases."", ""Great graphics, controls, and game play. But like a lot of other people I think it's needs a plot of some kind because we need more than just some little quests. I also want you to add the state of Nevada as a location. And please make it easier to get sheriff stars or at least lower the prices. Overall great game but I think you can make it greater. If you do add a plot try to make it about the player that's trying to take down a antagonist who's trying to spread darkness throughout the West."", 'I feel bad for giving a bad review but i need to try and make my point. I played this game on my old phone, a samsung 6, with no issues and loved it to absolute bits. I moved to the samsung 10e and reinstalled it but the game crashes before its really even open. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it a few times but it just wont work. If your phone will run it, its a really fun game with a good open world, go shoot a few critters out in the desert for me.', 'Amazing game. Controls and graphics are excellent, and the overall gameplay is outstanding. The fact it features things like full character customization, and the ability to free roam is really awesome. There are a lot of guns too. I like the fact that you can rush into battle guns blazing, like some kind of desperado. This game is amazing.', ""The game overall is entertaining. What's annoying and reason why I'm giving a 1 star is because the game keeps crashing after a while of playing. This game has had this same problem since about 2014. Also really get frustrated with the controls. I'm pressing the fire button and it shows that I'm pressing it and my gun will not fire. Takes multiple taps to get it to fire. Also the left stick/move button gets locked into one direction at times and has caused me to die while doing side quests."", 'Excited then disappointed, that\'s my experience with this game. VERY glad it\'s NOT yet another lame ""town builder"". Excited about the style, serious western theme, graphics, depth of play & customization. Annoyed by constant ""offers"" to turn on notifications & buy microtransactions. Dsappointed by bad controls. Aiming, walking, turning, etc is imprecise, jerky, seems to have a mind of its own that is in constant conflict with the user. Could be AWESOME, but isn\'t there yet.', 'Great game with plenty of gaming. Has many problems such as lags/ freezing up. Also very bad bugs where you can randomly get stuck not being able to do a mission for whatever reason. As well as possibly get mission revoked even after purchasing weapon for story. Needs a lot of updates and fixes. But seems promising with the right fixes.', 'Grab some popcorn cause this gonna be a long review. Would give it higher rating but their do be some big issues... well one issue... it keeps crashing and once it does the app doesnt wanna open back up for a little bit, it just says ""Six Guns Keeps Stoping"" Its very frustrating. The longest I\'ve got to play before it crashes was probably about 45 minutes tops but here lately it\'s been crashing in the first 2 minutes. Also need more ways to make money and obtain Stars. Still love this game :)', ""It crashes ALL the time upon launching now! The control stick often gets stuck, preventing me from changing direction, forcing me to restart the game, the attack button placement has me shooting and launching grenades when I don't want to, often killing me. Fast horses are also very difficult to control, making questing difficult. I would love this game if not for those problems."", ""This is ridiculous. First I purchased 2 packs that were on sale. The first one never even got to me which was supposed to come with some stars a rifle and a set of clothing. I chose to blow it off since it was only a dollar. Soon after the damn game crashed on me and shut down. Not to mention when I opened it up, it would keep kicking me out, saying it doesn't wanna work. Finally I reinstalled it and lost all my recent progress, bought a new pack of stars to restart and nothing. Money back now!"", ""I used to play this game years ago. I downloaded it again because I thought that it may have been updated by now... I was SADLY mistaken. i fact it seems more glitchy than I remember. The controls are TERRIBLE, and the game keeps crashing and won't open back up. I really like this game but its very frustarting to play with these issues. Please fix this !"", '4 years ago this whas my favorite game... Now it is just... Bad. the amount of ads are horrendous not to mention the fact it throws a thousand ways to pay the game. You can buy a second currency which is how you get some of the best gear in the game. It is a pay to win game, even though it says it isnt. I still somewhat love this game but... I really do prefer the version 4 years ago.', ""Fix the grabbing glitch. Its hard to grab anything. The hand doesn't want to pop up a lot. Game likes to not work by not opening. Kicking you out the game a lot to. While playing the game the screen will like to freeze and not work. You can ear everything and everything it moving but you cant click nothing to do anything. Game is being played with a new Samsung Galaxy s10+ have been playing the game since it came out. Back out on a iPod4. Out than that it works when that dont happen."", ""I have to restart my phone every time I want to load the game. Otherwise, the game crashes immediately after trying to open. When I do get to play, after a while the game totally freezes so I then have to restart my phone to open the app. It's in dire need of fixing. Other than that, what I have seen it's a really good game."", ""Six guns is badass. I love how it has a story mode. I've always been into aliens, demons, vampires, witches, zombies etc. This game has everything, that's what makes it exciting and interesting. I give it 3 stars because i can't play multiplayer mode and the app crashes a lot."", 'The gameplay, graphics, etc is ok. But controls sometimes stick and the game constantly freezes. Only way to get it to unfreeze is to lock/unlock the phone screen, then close/reopen the game. Massively annoying. And the game boasts free game play, but yet the game doesn\'t let you so much as ""borrow"" a weapon needed for a mission that you can\'t yet afford. So, to do said mission, you either need to waste time doing other side missions or use real money to buy game money to buy the weapon needed', ""it's my childhood game and what upset me is Saving cloud for it. I can't go back to my old account and it says connected but IT DIDN'T. just wanna say this I am so done with your game and I just spend on the game and lost everything gameloft please fix your game....."", 'I give this gane 3 star because this game is not opening when i download a game and played for one day and the next day the game will not opening i request you to fix this problem fast and fast if you can overall this game is best game of my life please fix this problem', ""Hi there, first of all the game was cool with its west side and story 🔥. But the control are suck. The game really need a remaster version since it was not update long ago. Now, coming to controls,we don't have proper graphics for specific device, sensitivity,vpad and audio voices were not that good. Gameloft is one of the best developer from mobile to PC. So, please give an updated version or else do the best remastered version of you guys can.... 🙏🙏🙏🙏"", ""The reason why I am giving it a four star is this, first It's glitching and whenever I log into the game sometimes it loses my progress in the game even when I don't have wife. For example login into game tells me that my progress is gone and I have to download some data. I don't even play it as often as much. And please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!make a second game to continue the story of the character and the circus event where you collect new weapons by winning challenges"", ""I love it. But I cant open it again. It worked the first time around, and then the next day, it keeps on crashing without starting. It just shows a black screen then turns off. I redownloaded it a few weeks later, but then it won't start. Doesn't even show a black screen. The app drawer goes landscape then returns to portrait (the app has crashed)"", 'The game as a whole is really fun and entertaining especially the storyline. Even the visuals are really good and the open world makes it even cooler. But. The aiming system can be sticky or slow, making it harder in the fast pace combat and the quick-turn and roll have awkward positioning. There also tends to be a glitch when both punching the demons and when they attack too. please check that. I really do love the game though and want to see further progress. All in all good job.', 'I was with this game from the beginning of its journey.. It was a helluva lot better then. Fast forward to today and the game is either lagging or freezes or crashes, not to mention that you need to try different angles for a very long time before the Hand appears for you to collect something. Please fix this. Six guns is one of the greatest games you ever made, apart from Gangster Rio.', 'The game\'s pretty good apart from two things: 1) The game keeps crashing when I try to enter. It takes me a very long time before I can actually play the game. For some reason it only happens on my newer Android device rather than my older one. 2) Please add a ""Restore progress"" button or feature when you log in with the same account on a different device. I\'d appreciate it if the game developers can help to fix these two issues. Thanks.', 'This game is great, lots of missions to do, free roaming is awesome but I have one major problem: this game is pay to win. There is one mission that has been bugging me for a while, it requires a weapon that costs 120000 gold, there is no way to farm that much gold without getting very, very bored. Everything costs too much and requires our real life money and missions do not pay enough to be able to cope with the insanely high weapon/clothing prices. Would give 5 stars if these were fixed.', ""The game in itself is quite nice, the graphics, storyline, adventures, missions etc. However, the application is quite unsatisfactory. After just a few hours the application started behaving mischievously and wouldn't start. Also the controls are not good, like to collect items you have to hover on them until the pointer appears and then you can collect them, this is particularly frustrating. I have uninstalled the app as it won't run. So until these problems are fixed, I don't recommend it."", ""Its an amazing game, but there are some lags, like stars dissapearing after I close the game, and some crashes and freezes, but I love the game. Highly recommended! Edit: So I uninstalled the game for more space, and when I was done I installed it again, but even though I logged in with both Google Play Games and Facebook, my data was lost. So until this problem is fixed, I'm rating it 3 stars."", ""The game is beautiful, playing it from my childhood, but the gameplay is super trash, camera movement is extremely annoying, it suddenly flicks to the left top corner of the screen... It happens a lot when I'm fighting with some monsters and humans. Besides, everytime I connect the game with google and reinstall the game, it makes me start all over again, it really needs some fix. I believe, if you can come up with a remastered version fixing the bugs and improving the graphics, it will rock."", 'Probably the only game left from the ""good-ol\' days"" when microtransactions weren\'t big. Compared to most other games around this is probably one of the least pay to win and best wild west game. However, that experience is completely broken by one problem: constant crashing. I don\'t know it\'s a problem from my phone, but every few minutes into the game, it will just freeze and close. A pity considering this game\'s potential.', 'Great game with excellent main story and very fun to play but more content would make it better. Lack of side stories; playing the current ones is getting repetitive. Also the maps do feel empty. More enemies wondering around  would be great. Apart from that, I love the weapons, outfits, visuals and the multiplayer mode (could you also make it playable using internet data and not just WiFi).', ""The scenario is beautiful!! The graphics could be better though. However, there is a glitch which led me to decide to delete this game is when the game crashes and i need to close my phone and restart the game. I don't have a big problem with this glitch, but once i was doing a mission which takes time, i was nearly going to finish the mission. The game crashes and when i restarted the game i should've started again the mission from the beginning. Hope you see this review and fix this problem."", ""This is such a nice game to be honest. I've been playing this game for like 4 Years now. And yeah I had alot of data resets because I change devices and stuff. But the thing is, the game keeps crashing like everytime I play it after not playing it for like a week, it doesn't let me play it and takes me to my home screen. Please fix this. I really wanna play. I'd appreciate it if you fix this bug. Thanks Gameloft Team."", ""I loved this game but it's always kick me after 10mins and get stuck in shooting mission near crystal Lake in map pls fix it"", ""Its a great game but i downloaded it more than once now and still the issue is the same. Every time i try to open the game it shows a black screen as if it is going in and the immediately it goes back to my home screen and when i try to close the app it doesn't even show that it was opend in the first place. I have to restart my phone each time i want to go in and when i go out i have to restart again if i want to play. Resolve please"", ""The game has a really good story and I like the detail of it overall it's really good game"", 'Interesting shooter open world game. Graphics is great.

I'm so frustrated I just completely uninstalled. Also the option to watch videos for coins will sometimes go days without letting me watch any ads, and the animals are so expensive theres no way to afford some of them without watching the ads, and I can't even do that."", 'Wonderful graphics and just love the sounds the animals make after feeding them! I went way past the 70th level- it kept on 70, but I still was able to add property for all the larger enclosures. When all was said & done, I told my daughter, ""Now this is one zoo I would pay big money to see!"" Keep up the good work. 2/01/22 In the past couple years since I last played this game, it really has gone downhill. I watch videos, don\'t get the coins. The elephants legs look chopped up. NOT GOOD!!!', 'fun, but a few annoying bugs! One of the tasks is to feed the elephants. when i click on to complete the task, the first time an apple came up to feed, but the second time just an arrow appears but no apple, and yet the apply keeps appearing inside the ghiselle cage, like constantly! there are a few others, but it is unplayable with these annoyances, hence only one star. if you fix all the bugs, i will re-rate.', ""I played for a few months, then every time I tried to open it, it would crash. I uninstalled and installed it again because it's a laid back game with good graphics and great animals. Now after about a month since then, the option to watch videos (it lets you do this every 24 hrs) is no longer working. It costs waaaay too much to expand the zoo and you don't get enough coins from shops and animals to do it just from those. Plus you are rewarded nothing for leveling up. I was enjoying it again."", ""The game itself shows promise. Obtaining animals is a fun mini-game (though it's a little frustrating when they run off regardless of how much you spend on bait) and the animations are varied. HOWEVER, even though I was asked to expand the zoo I can't do it for some reason, it's hard to obtain money (quests grant LESS money than they cost), relocation of decorations are impossible, and enclousures are too big. Worst though, are the advertisements. They disrupt the game randomly."", 'It\'s an alright game. I can\'t seem to find anywhere to link to FaceBook to let me play with my friends and my Wife. Wich is odd because there is a ""Friends"" menu to visit computer generated ""friends"" and their Zoos. Would be a great improvement to increase over all quality of the game. Gets a little boring after awhile too but the game concept is really good so there has got to be ways to build on this game and Improve it. I also find myself not using any decorations at all because I could use the space it uses, for something else to generate income and I\'m wondering if other people are doing this or if I\'m the only one or if maybe I\'m missing something and the decorations I\'m wasting could be adding some sort of anything to the game. You can\'t sell the decorations either so I\'m stuck with a bunch of things that I won\'t use and would rather sell for a few coins instead of wasting space in my inventory. There\'s a lot of promise in this game but you seem to miss really simple things to make it better and I don\'t understand how they were just missed so if there\'s a reason why it is how it is I\'d love to know the thinking process of how it came to be.', 'I like the game but it just has 1 bug. At a certain point when I have made progress in the game like about when I just reach the water types it like says ""You don\'t have enough space"" and I have to like Uninstall the game and re-download it but then it didn\'t save my data. And then I had to start all over again that\'s really annoying please fix it ASAP if you can.', ""I really do love this game... Problems : 1. Animals and expanding cost too much... Maybe lower the prices and add an option to buy coins? 3. Editing doesn't work well... Too difficult to move things around and in/out of storage... 3. THE GAME DESIGNERS DO NOT READ/RESPOND TO ANYONE'S REVIEWS! I love this game but it's very frustrating! PLEASE TRY FIXING IT!"", ""Once I put anything into storage, animals and items alike, the game will not let me take it back out. I am literally having to uninstall and restart the game as there doesn't appear to be a way around this. Thankfully I figured this out after only about 10 minutes of playing before sinking way more time in and having to restart then. The video ads to earn free animals does not work. I remembered this game from years ago and was excited at first, but it seems like the developers left it to rot."", ""I've been playing this game since I was ten. I have enjoyed the wide variety of animals you can get. Just a few tiny problems. I think the graphics could use a update. Also, the animals and quests don't give you enough money to match the cost of expansions and finding new animals. Last thing, it would be cool if you could cross breed real hybrid animals too. But besides that, I love this game!"", ""The game seems fun but the controls aren't that great. One of the major problems i have is trying to edit my zoo. You can't move roads that are on the right side of the animal homes. If you could rotate the screen that would solve this issue but because you can't, roads get stuck on the right side of the animals. It's pretty annoying."", ""This is a GREAT game. There is no other, and I mean NO OTHER zoo game anywhere on any appstore that will surpass this game in all aspects. The graphics are amazing. You can make animal hybrids and fantasy animals. There are freaking DINOSAURS and ICE AGE ANIMALS! The coin system is fair and easy to use. You don't need ANY in app purchases. The only thing that completely destroys it is that you can't use accounts, so if you transfer to a different account, you lose progress. Please please add."", ""It's a pretty good game but the only bad thing is that the ads don't work and they freeze whenever you want one of those three animals or dinosaurs another reason is you can like see through the animals like you can see like the legs on the right or left side. Rather that it is one of the best zoo games I've ever had but if you want one with better graphics I recommend Zoo 2 Animal Park."", ""This game could be a lot of fun if you could get more coins faster I have found after about thirty minutes of play I run out of funds. Takes too long to get more coins and after a few times of watching ads, it won't let you anymore. The cost of doing anything is way more than the coins you collect. An you don't get coins for leveling up. Concept is great though."", ""So far I am loving this game! The premium currency has been worked out, so now everything is obtainable with coins and watching optional ads. Great game, no real money needed, not even an option to use real money. Would give five stars, only issue is there doesn't seem to be a way to save your game data, so if you have to change devices goodbye zoo."", ""Nice but really buggy, every time I do the daily helicopter drop the game crashes and i lose the item but it goes back on a 24 hour timer. The only plus really is that the animals look great. Don't know if it's just me either but I dont have a HUD, and there's no way to turn one on"", 'I absolutely loved the game! But at one point I was running low on coins, so I watched a few ads. The next day when I used the same method, the game had started glitching out and I sadly can no longer play the game. I am still giving it a good rating though, because of how enjoyable it was. ☺', ""Fun game, need to watch the adds to get enough money to play. It would be a lot better if you had reserves you controlled to release the animals into. That you can build up with more waterholes, jungles, caves etc. The only animals that are in them are the ones you release. Otherwise over time it starts to get a bit boring. You don't bother trying to release them you just waste money trying to catch more."", ""It's a pretty progressive game which you can develop your zoo over a time with your own maintenance & strategy. But the main problem is the game doesn't progress in background. U have to keep looking into it all the time to feed animals & make coins. It can't auto-generate coins when you are off the game."", ""Was awesome, but now I can't watch video ads to get bonus coins, haven't been able to in over a week. I can still get videos to unlock animals but not the coin...please fix this, I find it very slow to progress without. Would bump 3 1/2 star up to 4 1/2 once this issue is fixed. If you get it back to how it was, fun game and look forward to seeing what new animals you may add. There are many more in all categories that you can add (including dinos, ice age and the myth/legendary categories)."", ""It's a good game even for an adult like me, but it has problems. 1: It doesn't let you edit properly. 2: once you put the animal in the bucket, it doesn't let you take it out. 3: you can't rotate your building etc. 4: it doesn't let you save it like other games, so once you loose it, all gone. 5: give option on the game to report complaint not website, it will be easier and keep the interest on the game. 6: graphic can be better. ...but I love the game, wish I can save it."", ""I've played this game on many different devices for years, and it's so much fun! You can save animals, breed them, unlock new animals, release them to save the species (there are so many species!), decorate your zoo and so much more! The animals are adorable, the adventure aspect as you search for animals is crazy fun, and you really feel good when you save a species. Would recommend to literally anyone who likes animals regardless of age or experience, as it is easy with many features!"", ""This has a lot going for it (like the rescue mini-game and that it isn't all about present day creatures) but the reserve needs to be more customizable to hold my attention. The enclosures could at least look different for each animal. Also, automate feeding. Small details: The edit controls would be improved by adding a 'move currently selected object to here' tap. It's unclear whether the guides you can hire to help find animals actually have any effect. I've had terrible luck with them."", ""Very fun game. Great graphics! Lots of animals to collect, even the prehistoric and mythical ones. My issues here are: the shortage of coins, the animals don't give enough coins nor the mission rewards. After buying from the store or catching animals and completing the mission, the rewards don't give you much; the paths. It's hard to place them and remove them one by one, should instead have a pathing mode, should not be in a storm. I love this game! One of the best park/tycoon games here."", ""Just deleted this Game due to not being able to watch more videos to gain coins. Other than that, the game has been great, but takes forever to get anywhere due to not having enough coins. Also, not fair that it takes more coins to complete tasks than the coins you receive for completing them. It's like taking one step forward and two steps back. Severely disappointed as this game really started off fantastic."", ""Fantastic game. Appears you dont have to spend real money on anything, but its so slow paced. I can't get enough ads it keeps telling me to try again later... i have only watched one. It makes it difficult to expand because collecring money is hard... this is otherwise exactly what i was looking for in a zoo game."", 'It was fun at first but really unbalenced. You have new areas open really fast and lots of animals to choose from but you veey very quickly run out of room to house them, to have more room you need coins the only way to get coins is through ads and it only allows you to see about 3-4 ads. And its not very clear on what buffs or advancements you get when realising the families of animals. No bonuses then you ""save the species"". The is no reason to release them.', ""I absolutely love this game. I love how theres lots of different animals and dinosaurs and how they ACTUALLY move around in their habitats. I also love that you have to catch them and how you have to feed them and see if they like it or not. But there are two things that I don't like about the game, it's that I basically have to watch ads to extend my sanctuary (because lack of money), and that I can't capture any more animals. These issues are now making the game boring for me. Pls fix them."", ""Good game. Nmcoins per animal and amenities are limited based mostly on add watching, but the rewards are great and wonderfully set up so you don't have to watch 10 adds to get minimal payoff. Great structure. Just wish we could watch more adds... as odd and off as that sounds."", ""I played this when I was younger. (7 years ago) It's still just as bad as it was then. No way to save it long term. Hard to edit and move paths. The animals occasionally, though consistently, glitch so you can see inside there leg. Not to mention the crate box to capture and release animals is animated and designed wrong. Ow, and the helicopter crates have given me 5 red flowers and not much else."", ""You run out of coins very fast, can't do quest very much due to no coins or anything like that, ALWAYS SAYS NO INTERNET CONNECTION WHEN YOU HAVE SOME!!!!!!! It was fun at first but thinking of uninstalling the game!!!! Don't play this game unless you want issues like me and many others."", ""This game has been closing on its own for two years it keeps saying no internet connection keep in mind all this for two years straight then the game has no update that's why it don't work properly please fix it or JUST THROW THE WHOLE GAME AWAY it's a glitching game that needs to be done away with. Nobody wants to play a horrible game like this. So yall get 1 star until I see a difference."", 'Its very good, but stuff get exspencive very soon, also like, you expand your zoo a little and it costs like hell so... And also the game is very old, i remeber me playing is as a kid 5 years ago, nothing has changed. The game is simply very old. It truly needs an update. If yoir gonna work on asphalt 8, 9 etc, then delete this game.', ""It repeatedly exits the game, i used to play this on an older device and ran perfectly fine. I don't understand how it cannot handle newer devices. I'm sorry that I no longer like your game, but it's not like you care as you haven't put out an update since I last played it 7 years ago on an old kindle fire. I'm just plain disappointed."", ""The game itself is really good! Amazing graphics, and 'mini games'. However, the only issue I have are slight bugs. It won't allow me to expand my park; I tried using the quest and pressing 'go' but nothing happens"", ""Excellent game! The only problem is the zoo doesn't expand enough for all the animals and shops! I am lvl 50 and have no room to place anymore habitats! I have maybe room for 10 shops. So can't really decorate the zoo! Not sure why people complain about collecting money! Click shop, money appears next to it simply click the add button and tap away. Free coins! I think it's a great game definitely not a force you to spend any money at all! Keep up the great work!"", ""Love the game! This game is a big part of my childhood. I remember playing Wonder Zoo with my cousin. We used to watch so many ads that we earned more than 1 million coins everyday. We used to spend it on buying exotic animals, amazing dinosaurs, decoration etc. But now I'm only able to watch 6 ads per day. Please increase the number of ads you can watch a day."", 'The wonder zoo games in my java phone is much better than this one, my suggestion is to bring it back again, it is way more better when it comes in story, decor, and you can add more different trees that provide foods unlike in this version. In this version also, there is no icon in how many foods you were collected. Above all, it is not good as before, so not recommended to others.', 'Changing my 3 stars to 4 stars. Glad to see visiters was added since I last played. Still need a gate for visiter payment. Also a bit glitchy. When I place a dustbin for example the play buttons just disappears, almost like the dustbin sucks it in. Same thing happens when restarting the game. Please fix the glitches.', 'It is a wonderful app. I love it and playing it makes me feel like having a real zoo.

com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftCMHM,City Mania: Town Building Game,"Welcome to the best new city builder game in town.
Now is your chance to be the owner of the awesomest city ever! Build, expand, plan your strategy -- the decision is in your hands.
But don't stop there! Recruit dozens of funny characters, add them to your collection and watch as they populate the streets and bring your city to life!

Craft hundreds of unique, gorgeous buildings in your city and expand it from a tiny peaceful town to a big bustling metropolis.
Don't forget to decorate your skyline by building famous landmarks, like the Eiffel Tower, the Tower of London and the Leaning Tower of Pisa (there's something for every tower fan) to elevate your city to the top of the tourist destinations list.

Meet and collect tons of funny characters with their own unique personalities, like the portly Sergeant Morecake, and the uber-macho builder guy, Forest Manley (whose real skill is the tiny-bit-too-suggestive eyebrow raise).
Build a water tower. Check! Build a fire station. Check! Assigning Bizzies to jobs will help you optimise your city, but you can go even further! Send them on missions and they won't come home empty-handed, or do favours for them so they invite their friends to fill your city.

The future: age of smart forks, exploding hover boards, even selfies! But now the 21st Century lives up to its promise, with the ability to merge buildings into advanced skyscrapers and unlock specialisations.

Unlocking each allows you to develop your city in different directions and expand your collection with specialised buildings such as Sustainability, Commerce, Education and Entertainment. Choose which one suits your strategy best.

In case you find yourself short on some crucial resources, visiting the Marketplace should be a major part of your strategy; it's where you can collect some extra cash or find missing upgrade items.

I love the art style and the game play and unlike some others I don't mind the wait on bizzies during merges because I have so many other games to occupy me in the mean time. What I cannot forgive is the random ads that as far as I can tell you don't have any way to stop. It's one thing to make it expensive like 20 bucks or something to remove ads or to make it a subscription service but it's a whole other kind of frustrating to not give an option at all."", 'So, the game draws you in during the first 5 levels or so by quickly leveling you up, providing enough funds to purchase the necessary buildings. Then, as funds dwindle, your housing stops producing funds because the cost of the other buildings needed to keep the residents happy are WAY too high. Meanwhile, while production times for the items are not bad, the time it takes for a new resident to ""bake"" or whatever, is WAY too long (I only got to extra resident #4 when it said it would take 16 hours, who has time for that?). So, the concept is cute, graphics are nice, but the cost and wait time just isn\'t worth it. Uninstalled.', 'Fun little sim! I, however, had the same issues as others with stuck ads and lag. I would have happily paid for an ad free version, the ads are relentless in some cases every couple of clicks/touches. Graphics are good, was quite fond of the hired helps\' animations and overall game. Super excessive ads and the fact that it would definitely would be a major cash sink to have any of the ""premium"" buildings are my major gripes. Has a ton of potential!', ""Fun until it becomes unplayable. I've installed this game FOUR times. First it would freeze every time I tried to move a road and sometimes when I clicked on a Bizzie. Uninstall and reinstall and it was fine for several levels until it would stay on the loading screen a long time then force close. Uninstall and reinstall and same thing happened after several levels, again. Then a third time. The developer was no help with the issues. Not wasting any more time on this glitchy game."", ""Fun game but some items are quite expensive (especially Bizzies). I've been trying to save up enough game bucks to get certain ones, too, but unfortunately have lost a few hundred due to accidentally tapping on a button which causes instant production a number of times. There should be a warning asking to confirm when you're about to spend a lot of bucks. I'd be willing to spend some actual money in this game if things weren't so ridiculously overpriced. $100 for a robot Bizzie? Ha!"", 'I downloaded this game today and I really like it, its an inventive take on a town building game, but I have to delete it because its stuck in one spot where it talks about missions. I tried everything, from restarting my phone, getting into the game and back out of it, and then I tried giving the game access to my location... unfortunately nothing worked. Maybe later :-)', 'It started out ok but got complicated very quickly. To advance in the game you have to spend actual money. THERE IS NO EDIT MODE, I REPEAT, THERE IS NO EDIT MODE. So while you try to move buildings, change roads, etc. It effects the moral and the population of your city. This is the first ""build a city game"" Ive played where there is no edit mode. And the radius for the public service buildings are way too small, its very frustrating.', 'Not worth installing. Game play was worth three or four stars, but the one thing that kills the game is the random spontaneous ads--they occur very frequently (every 60 seconds in one play session), and there is no warning or indication an ad is about to play. Many times, I tap and scroll, only o have an ad occur and intercept my tap, forcing me to not only close the ad, but also to back out of whatever effect tapping the ad caused. In the PC world on the web, this would be called ""click jacking"", and is considered malware. Yet this game does it constantly. At least the developer could give some warning, such as an onscreen warning ""ad in 10 seconds...""', ""I give 4 stars because the game is amazing.. super fun and easy.. only problem is there should be a way to make more money.. all the water, power and sewage plants get super expensive the more you buy and I have people leaving the city because I cant afford more facilities. I try selling things but it seems to take a whole day to get the profits. I dont want to delete the game but if I cant get people back into the city because I'm always broke, I may have to."", ""Giving one star due to terrible progression mechanics attempting to force you into making purchases. There's no real way to progress without spending a lot of money, as the game will unlock new services you need to provide and suddenly your whole town requires upgrades and rearrangement, and you won't have the finances. Given how many ads the game beats you over the head with, they make plenty of money without me paying them any more. Uninstalled."", 'Seems fun enough, and the graphics are cute. But once I got through the unskippable tutorial, I got trapped into an ad -- ""it\'s independence day, take 60% off select packs "" keeps coming right back up after I close it, so I can\'t actually play the game. I\'ve closed it about 20x so far.', ""I downloaded this game because it sounded fun and had good reviews. However it won't get past the download part at the beginning of the game. It gets partway through and then says there is a network error do you wish to try again. Twice i restarted the process and both times it did the same thing! I am very upset because it sounded like a good game but I can't get it to work!!!"", ""the way ads work in this game turned me off it completely. it seems like a cute game (albeit a complete clone with different graphics of simcity), but the fact that every couple minutes, ads literally pop up right in your screen and you tap them on accident because you're in the middle of a task is just ridiculous. I don't mind ads for upgrades and whatnot but the popups are far over the top. uninstalling purely because of the invasive ads."", ""started out fun got frustrating REALLY quick. first annoyance was that every 15-30 seconds it toggles between night and day; after awhile it begins hurting your eyes trying to adjust, especially at night. Second, it gets to a point where you can't expand your city area fast enough to keep updating enough to not lose population. I couldn't update my storage enough either. last I only kept getting the same bizzies and also couldn't keep pace lvling up fast enough to take missions. poor execution"", ""This is probably the best City game I have ever played, I only got 2 issues though. It requires strong wifi/data and I have good data but it sometimes say u lost connection and the 2nd thing is when I play for about 30 mins it says City Mania has stopped (it crashes) can u fix the issues plz...other then that, it's the best game. This is my 2019 game 😁😁😁"", ""I really want to give this game 5 stars because the game itself deserves it. The issue I have is that you can only skip production time with ads x amount of times. and that makes no sense to me. I understand the idea of making the player wait for production time so that they come back but in reality that just gives the player time to lose interest and download apps from your competitor. aside from that it's an absolutely fantastic game that I highly recomend for anyone interested in this genre."", 'Easy to learn. Involved if you want to be. Pay off if you work at it. Exactly what i want from a city building game. The constant ads have stopped (thank you!). No need to buy anything to succeed or keep from being bored. Been playing for weeks and love it on every level.', 'I love the music, the Bizzies, and that the cars interact with the buildings you are putting up. But having to keep rearranging areas to appease the population, is quite annoying. I like it now, but I see us parting ways after awhile. Out-of-pocket games have that effect.', 'Easy and very addictive, yet yielding out very small amounts of coins, however the costs of buildings are extremely expensive. Although I will spend real money to advance by choice, this game pretty much demands you to spend money to grow which takes any fun had away from the gameplay, will give 5 star rating when either you give more coins or lower the costs of buildings', ""Game is horrible at connecting to the internet regardless of whether I'm connected to fast wifi or not. Reporting an issue is difficult and asks too much personal info over just asking what the bug is. Trying to complete a set at the pipeline automatically brings up a network error window and restarts the game every single time, again, regardless of the speed of internet I'm connected to."", ""I LOVE this game! Would be EVEN BETTER if it didnt take so long for the bizzies to trait mix! && you don't get much money from completing simple things. I have progressed pretty far. Just would like to see a better payout. & most of the time it says my internet connection isnt good and wont let me watch some videos to spin the wheel or to complete stuff faster! Fix these few things ... I will definitely give this a 5 star rating!"", ""This is one of the best city building games I have ever played, it's definitely a bootleg version of the SimCity BuildIt. Especially the part where you can combined bizzies' traits to get a new one. I've recommended to any new player who is looking for a good game. Five-star rating from me! Excellent work!"", 'GRAPHICS ARE AWESOME! I\'m giving this a 3 star as it\'s connection dependent and the ""bizzies"" made it a little confusing. There\'s just too many things to do now. Also, not being able to choose how a house/building should look like kind of makes it... 🙁 (uhmm, I\'m building and designing my own city right?). It\'s complicated. I\'ve played the older version so I\'ve seen the difference. Just wanted to share my opinion.', ""One of the BEST city building games! Lots of things to do each session you play. I give it a perfect score for such an achievement. Well developed. Supports full screen and teardrop displays. One grip would be that the interface encroaches into the world view. Should be able to minimize it for clean screen view and also move it to the edges. It has a big gap from the edge of the screen. It's too playing safe that there are no overlaps."", ""Generally the graphics and control are quite wonderful, I really love how I can move around at every angles of my town. However I found a couple of problem. First, the game losts an internet connection almost every few minutes, I've tried both cellular and wifi, the problem still exists. Second, some level-10 buildings cannot be fused even I put them together. I don't know what to do but this is really annoying cuz I cannot do what I plan to do with my city. Hope I can find a solution soon."", ""It was good at the beginning. I do love the system in the game, especially the Bizzies. Then came the problem with network connection, which wasn't real at all. I was at level 22 when the hypertube part crashed and other parts followed. I tried uninstall/reinstall and seemed to lose all the things I have done. Bye-bye my Bizzies. I swear I don't wanna leave you guys like that but the game made me do. Also, the wheels just won't give the needed tools easily - which I mean too difficult. Not nice."", ""Most of the time game is cute, takes a.long time to make certain things tho which is a shame, have to wait for hours so end up going off the game, storage upgrade needs to be changed, you should be able to apply collected items one at a time rather than wait until you can't actually store anymore upgrade items as you need so many, same with land upgrades. Mainly great except now it's not working and I can't actually play, load up and freeze :("", ""The game is progressing good, add a little touches here and there and it can compete with the more popular city simulation games in Google Play. Suggestion to the Developers: make a edit function to that can easily take out all the terrain and infrastructure so that we players have an easier time on editing our dream city. As well as fix some glitches, I've experienced having not to move the buildings and can't put pathways. Thanks!"", ""On the plus side, it's like Sim City build it, but with little added extras that make the game more fun to play. On the down side, constant ads that just pop up whilst you're playing and the fact that it never remembers you've switched off all the notifications are really ruining any enjoyment whilst playing this."", ""I love it very much. But then I realised that this game never appreciate my efforts and data usage : 1) It's difficult to get materials for all upgrades. 2) Even when I decided to watch ads to get materials, it often gives me ONLY 100 coins. 3) Hypertube also makes me frustrated because it is very difficult to get the ticket. Average bizzies are level 15, but I have 2 bizzies level 45, and the missions always for level 47. 4). Coin mission only gives 150 coins."", ""I like the game a lot however the bizzies do get frustrating when I've waited half a day to nearly a full day to open it and it's a duplicate.. some things are far too expensive which can be disappointing I would like to interact with my bizzies more, wish they were easier to acquire as well. But I enjoy the game overall."", ""Before you can play you're asked your age(required) and gender. Once you can play fullacreen video ads automatically every 5 minutes or so. There's an ad ticket in the settings menu. You also can't pay to get rid of ads, which is fine by me since I didn't find the game entertaining anyways. Abnormally, initiating resource generation and building requires sliding gestures rather than simple taps."", ""at first i thought this was a pretty good game with some bugs and occasional crashes. now i have run out of land and there is no more available. merging buildings is a joke as most of the suggested locations don't work. the items needed to upgrade are difficult to obtain and are rarely for sale. time to uninstall i think 😥"", 'The graphics are great, and its fun to zoom to really see your city upclose. But the reach of the service buildings (firefighters etc) are to small. And the Ui should perhaps be customizable, especially the upgrade ones they take too much space. Oh yeah and the ads dont work, But still overall a nice game.', ""It has an annoying bug that could not be fix by closing the apps. In the hypertube in the game shows that the item i had was 3 of 4 needed. Meanwhile, in my storage shows 5 of the item. Even after closing the apps and reopen, it showed the same. In my head, it forced me to use my hard earn money. Thats not interesting at all. I thought this game was as good as sim city. Apparently, I'm wrong. Recommended NOT to play this game."", ""This game is literally just a cute clone of SimCity Buildit, with a few extras added in here and there (such as random ads you never asked for, or people to high-five). The way you build, the upgrade system, the way it manages resources such as power and water - everything, it's the same game with a different art style. I am actually amazed they haven't been sued by EA for making a game so similar to theirs. Looks nice though, has that going for it."", ""Love the mixin feature. The only downside is hard getting items for specific upgrade. Marketplace feature doesn't help since other user scalping that. It would be nice if you add trade system."", 'Nice Graphics, quite detailed. A lot of items and various Characters (Bizzies). Dunno why, I hv to reload 2-3x to get in the game. Ads are everywhere, long ads (>15sec), even in the middle of the game, ads can pop-up. Really need Real Cash to get most of the items and Bizzies. Connect to WIFI, & the game always force closed (cant be login). Start to boring with this game.', ""*TOO MUCH ADS ON GAMEPLAY* I was playing around 1 hour and game showed mo than 10 ads, it was displayed on banners when you tap on a factory or a store, ad videos showed every 3 minutes and makes this game unplayable.

Sometimes, graphics quality get down, and i don't know why."", ""fairly fun, only for bizzies.. good graphics.. fair feature, ads, money spending challange.. but, gets boring at some points.. it is likely a lesser 'sim city build it' but with bizzies, which is not satisfying.. you get 3 stars because of bizzies, please remember this! without bizzes, i give you 2 star for less building and annoying sliding ad.. if this game prio is bizzies, you should add more modifier feature on bizzies. i want to see only hoomie or police bizzie, which cant do.. cant create multiple bizzies..suprisingly broken daily mission level caps.. it's hard to level up after lvl 15, but game always increase the level needed as we often do daily mission, which is very annoying.. i know, that was kind of challenge, but i can say that was a challenge anymore, its kind of frustrating. the seller marketplace still not playing right.. we got all the notification, but not with juice?? are you kidding me?? less specialization building, which is unsatisfying at some points to see the same building.. game disconnect on idle, this is very annoying for me.. and many more to criticize except for bizzies.. please kindly remember, that bizzies really save this game..""]",False,"['com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftL2HM', 'com.storm8studios.citynext', 'com.rbx.city.android', 'com.sparklingsocietytycoon.tropictownislandcitybay', 'com.sparklingsocietysims.towncityparadisebuildingsimgame']","['com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA9HM', 'com.gameloft.anmp.sniper.champions', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDMHM', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA8HM', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDOHM']",com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftCMHM,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftCMHM&hl=en&gl=us

But I play to be relax and this game must be complicated because it has tips and arrows for every, single move for at least the first five minutes of the game. The tips were so long, related to game elements unseen as yet, that I'm sure I won't remember them when I get to them. The theme is great though! But it seems very simple (tap the next arrow), and not challenging *at all*. And I don't even like difficult games."", 'After I reached the 1st tropical island the game started freezing all the time. The portal to scratlantis is a joke, not once has it loaded fully. It gets to 99% and the app closes itself. There are some major operating bugs going on here. After reeding other reviews it seems that a lot of people are have the exact same issues, and these have been a problem for several months.', 'This game would have gotten 5 stars, but everytime I finish on an island and press the home button, the game freezes right as the characters returns to the home base. As it is I have to log out and log back in just to get the game unfroze which is very annoying. Other than the freezing I have fun playing the game.', ""Me and my daughter LOVE to play this game together, but ever since the new ads, the game constantly crashes on my Android. If you press too soon when an ad shows, I get an error message then it freezes, when the heros go home, the game freezes right before they get off the ship, causing me to close and reopen after each trip, and now I can't be apart of the Events becsuse it's stuck and I cannot claim my prize for an event that ended 4 days ago. Tried clearing cache and nothing. Please fix."", 'I originally loved this game so I redownloaded it and now it\'s freezing again. I\'ve reported or ""sent feedback"" multiple times but it continues to freeze when heading back to the mainland AND Scratlantis doesn\'t work at all but it eats my tokens. Also the mini events have stopped working completely for me and I haven\'t even left Mannychusettes island. What\'s going on!? Why hasn\'t this been fixed!? Seriously considering uninstalling this game once and for all.', 'Love ice age. Great way to pass the time as well, but the devs need to work on the events a bit. Evey day has a new objective, but many times I try to Collect my reward and it gives me a ""cannot connect"" or ""cannot claim rewards"" but I have internet and a good connection. So, definitely needs a bug fix. It\'s not a problem on my end. Unless there\'s something I missed....', ""Too many glitches. Randomly crashes, won't give you event earnings because it gets hung up and keeps saying retry, takes too long to earn acorns and berries. Also crashes when you return from adventures and you have to close out the app and reopen it to continue playing. Goes to 99% to enter whirlpool then crashes so you can't play that area. Never shows videos so you can't earn things that way either"", 'When I updated the game to fix sum glitches it, it fixed them thanks, but at level 16 berry and level 16 shell holders (?) I had 336k berries and 502k shells, now 226k berries and little over 300k shells you need a lot of both to due things in the game, what the deal??? In the next "" fix "" I would like those back. Been playing the game for awhile and almost have all the animals,', ""Love the game great game but can you fix the game to where it doesn't crash everytime I come home since I expanded to the tropical island and entering Scratlantis? Haven't been able to even go to it one time since it's been open I love the game and would give it 5 stars but don't think us keep spending money on in-app purchases to play your game if half of the game is unplayable. Can you please fix this issue I've noticed on the forums that it's pretty common for everybody."", 'Once you get to a certian point you can only play for small periods of time unless you want to buy items. The game gives you berries and other prizes just for opening it but when its pushing a sale it will make you bypass the ""claim"" function to see their $$$ deals and then not allow you to claim them. All and all it\'s cool and entertaining as a game to fill the time up until you save Diego then it really pushes the sales part. Ultimately deleted the game', 'A great game! As a fan of the ice age trilogy, its awsome, its fun, but there is some points i want to point out and if they get fixed the game would be a 💯 must to play, 1- try to take care of free to play players a bit like make a more guranteed way of getting acorns because the game really pushes you to use acorns in a lot of stuff (Like speeding up,building bridges for certain animals) 2-Care about the bugs, like the freind system 3- update the game,like add more content, Thats all rlly', ""It's fun to play in the beginning (despite it crashing once or twice), but after the littlest while you can't progress without actually paying. It isn't fun anymore and I'm not prepared to pay real money for something that's that useless in the actual game. You need A LOT of berries to chop only a few trees. The mini games, especially the running game, is annoying to play as well. Deleting this game. Do not recommend at all."", 'I have played this game for years and enjoyed it a lot. I have played it àll the way to the last of the volcanic islands until my phone was updated early this month then my game could not finish downloading but I kept trying until it finished loading successfully but now it is not opening...please do the needful, I really miss it. Collecting of items to open brigdes can be very frustrating at times. Please restore my game for me.', 'In the begining, this game is fun, but when you start moving on to more and more islands, it costs so much. Also not to mention that half of the game doesent work, its so old, you cant watch ads anymore. Also update the game! You update it once a year to fix some bugs. Make new content for once!', ""Love this game.... BUT it's impossible to progress once you unlock the Dino islands. How can possible continue this game without spending close to $100. I need 1200 acorns to finish the islands and collect the last animals before I can move on. I have been saving acorns for months now and still only have 66. I'm literally stuck with no way of moving on. I refuse to pay $100's just to open the next island, which potentially I would have to do the same thing."", ""It is really a awesome game. I'm still. Playing it. It's over 2months now. But i hade already unlocked many regions in ice. After tropical region gets unlocked all the animals plus the extra animals from the turtle journey all go. To tropical area.... Whereas ice region has so many blank places to fill up animals. I get that tropical animals stay in tropical region. But still some can stay in ice region as I have unlocked many using the shells. Can you please make this an update next tim?"", ""I enjoyed it first but then I got stuck at certain level tried many times by reinstalling it still the result is same... As per today my berry bowl got stuck at 16 level and won't show upgrade option.. And because of that i can't play further... Their is no proper upgrading system in this game"", ""The game has a lot of malfunction: the artefacts doesn't open, you can not upgrade the berry or shell, you ca not see video to earn prizes etc.... so you just spend time to play and then you find you can not play the game anymore because of the malfunction!"", ""Having played this game since January I can now no longer progress within the game. I have a challenge to collect jewels from the whirlpool and there are no jewels. I can't open the tropical artifact and I can't upgrade my berry and shell bowls from level 15 to 16 which means I can't progress any further into the game. Please sort it out."", ""Been playing this for months on new iPhone but still I have to wait days with continuous spins of island roulette with no avail to animals or things to unlock bridges. when I need the requirements like straw or conch it goes on and on and on. How long for the right results? Took me four days to finally get straws in my scrat run! Pay pay pay with time or money you decide. If you pay with both like myself don't bother!!!!"", ""Loved this game but now it takes so much time to do anything. Not to mention I can't upgrade my berry or shell storage from level 15 and I need 16 for one of my tasks and to unlock the next island! So frustrating after playing this game for months!"", ""well , a very nice , time killing and intersting game . the only main issue is that the guys at gameloft aren't answeing for any question nor helping ... they direct you to the support form which is so complicated ... to many issues at the moment , which makes it a bad axpirience after you get so involved in the game ."", 'I liked the game the 15 minutes that it let me play. Game froze then had an error message. Would not let me do anything. I had to exit out when i was able to. i just ended up uninstalling the game.', ""At the beginning it was very good game... But when u reach a level that you can't move because of bugs and no update in 4 month.. u loose interest in this game. And u tried to contact Gameloft. Nobody answers you."", ""Seems fun, but I'm not too far into it, and I have to quit playing. It won't let me go to the next island (New Snowington) even though I've completed all other tasks, and have gotten all the animals."", ""Its fun & all until it stops working 😐 literally I have cleared out all the islands, rescued everyone yet it still says I missed someone. I can't even progress in the game, I've tried deleting it, restarting my phone yet nothing works."", ""I am having some type of problem with this game already because I'm trying to do some quests like upgrading the food and collect items from the whirlpool area but it won't let me do that."", ""The game is admittedly nice but there are a couple of bugs that need sorting out for it to get more stars. One of the most annoying bugs is that berry and shell bowl aren't able to upgrade to level 16 yet but it is required to be able to explore more islands. The artifact required to unlock scratlantis is also really hard to get and despite trying for almost a month, I still haven't gotten it. Regardless, it's a fun game to play and a good way to pass the time. Hope the bugs are patched soon!"", 'This is a really good game. When I first installed about a week, maybe 2 weeks ago. I would 100% given the game at least 5 stars. But recently, in these last 3 days everytime I sail back to my village it freezes. I can still hear the sound effects but screen has frozen, which is why my rating has dropped to 3 stars. Please fix this and I will enjoy playing it again, my rating will go back up too.', ""The gave me an option of getting more shells and berries in replace of a few animals I had rescued. Turns out you cant get them back even but continuation of playing. You cant get past a certain level without having Manny (one of the animals lost). You cant even get it with acorns so I was stuck on a certain level. You should think through your procedures clearly. Please notify me on how to fix it. Please notify me in order to fix this. Other than this it's an exciting game."", ""Can you please be generous enough to fix the issue. I have been reporting/sending feedback multiple times now but no action is taken. Please fix this issue. It's very annoying when the game crashes in between. When I sail to an island and return back home, the game freezes. Also, I cannot enter Scratlantis. It sure eats my token but when I enter, the game freezes and I've to restart again. I don't want to quit playing this addictive game. Please help me out here..."", ""I used to play this game on my old phone and while it has addictive gameplay and plenty to keep you occupied it crashed a lot. Now I'm finding this is still a problem on my new phone years later. It completely freezes everytime I arrive back home from an island now and keeps doing so everytime I play which is very frustrating. I uninstalled and then reinstalled and it still does it. It has also been shutting itself down when I try to enter the whirlpool and on events. Sort it out Developers!"", ""Fun, addictive game but it crashes everytime I return to the home island after exploration, which is alot. It is also very easy to accidentally spend golden acorns.. Very annoying, but I'd be furious at this had I purchased some using real money. The game also crashes at 99% every time I enter the whirlpool in the lower left of the map. Maybe look into fixing thses issues?!"", ""This is a really good game, but after closing some ads, the game freezes. I have to restart the game every time and it's really annoying. Also, even though I have found all the animals on Iceview Isles, the game keeps saying that there are more, and won't let me proceed to New Snowington. I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the bugs. Please fix them! 🙏"", ""I love this game but, recently on returning home from adventures the game freezes and needs rebooting. Also the spinoff game where you go down the whirlpool, takes your tokens but freezes and shuts down before you get there, thus not able to play it therefore other parts of the top game can't be achieved. When this is fixed ..top game. All ages. This is still happening..but now I can't get the game to work at all, since the last update.."", ""I love the game I've been playing it non-stop for months but 1. Lately it's been crashing every time I go back home from an island and I have to restart it every time. 2. Scratlantis doesn't work at all, the game crashes every time I open it. 3. I rescued all the animals from Sandchester Islands and I'm trying to move on to the next one, Buenos Windy, but it still says I have to rescue the parents from the previous island when I obviously already have. Please fix it."", ""Absolutely dissatisfied. I downloaded the game for the second time after a while knowing I enjoyed the game but couldn't remember why I deleted it (now I know!). First the game crashes everytime I try to enter Scratlantis, it loads to 99% then the app closes and I've used most of my Scratlantis blue prints for what! Second when I started using the turtle to stifling shores the app freezes everytime I return home. This happens even with the boat. Need more space for this review. 8 more issues!"", ""It's nice but there are times when I have lost at least about 40 Golden acorns over the course of the game. There were two boss fights I lost 20 acorns. I lost the other 20 to daily streaks when they didn't get added to my collection. But it is a fun game. The Scratlantis area I can't access, the return from an adventure freezes I must then close the game reopen and continue. I have had tasks remain incomplete simply cos it doesn't register they complete. No way round it."", ""Well I love this game but it glitches when it is loading and takes a long time to load.

","[""The loading. The game is PHENOMENAL; BUT... that's while you are playing. Easily, 60% of my total time from opening app, to ending was spent watching ALOT of loading screens that most of the time, I would get annoyed and just close it, try again some other time. It's so frustrating. It's constant loading, constant freezing up with the elemental balls spinning icon never stops... By the way, this is ACROSS devices . 4 galaxy phones, 2 Alcatel tablets and now on my new sams tablet, WONT LOAD! 🤦🏻"", ""missions cannot be completed because of an issue. Enemies should never be allowed to retreat under invincibility only to regain full health and continue fighting. (This is considered cheating) Please remove this option immediately.😡 The game also crashes at the worst times & some of the chests refuse to open. No matter how many times you hit some enemies they just won't die and you get hung up in a stage. I have video recordings of all this. Resetting or reinstalling, doesn't work."", ""Biggest issue is the Solo Level 17 map glitch; end of map constantly causes the entire app to freeze and prevents further game progress. Outside of that, progress is limited to rushing old levels and weekly dungeons for decent equipment, chests have very fickle drop rate even with rates up. Pay-to-play is a major factor here and I'm holding off playing this anymore until bug fixes are addressed."", 'game could be awesome. graphics are good, gameplay is fun but the movement is rough. always getting caught on stuff and it\'s really hard to tell the difference between, breakable and non, objects. I wish the items and gold would auto pick up or at least gravitate towards you. The tutorial is annoying, like everyone else says, and most importantly it won\'t let me play because it, ""needs to download"". Which would be no issue except there\'s no way to get it. Just crashes the game..', 'First thing, the rating is at a 2 due to the amount of ads and pop ups (usually offers for x amount) during the game. Majority of Gamelofts games are P2W. You can play freely, but the unbalances make it difficult to really enjoy the game. However, if you consistantly play the game, I recommend buying their starter pack. It gives you a nice boost in the beginning. Graphics are smooth and controls are intuitive. If it were not for all the ads and offers, rating would be a 4.', ""Loved playing the game at first! It was awesome, always stuff to do, you could grind or just relax and enjoy the gameplay. Love the stronghold aspect where you challenge other player's bases and can be rewarded. I played this game for so long and had really built up quite a collection. Upon installing a large update and logging in, IT ASKED ME TO CREATE A CHARACTER!! I tried for weeks to figure out where my save files went, to no avail. Bad customer support. Don't invest your time."", ""At first the game is fun, upgrades are readily available and you can progress at a reasonable pace... then after a few months, the upgrades are nearly impossible and you need to purchase them to make any headway. I'm now deleting it... was fun while it lasted but it's a luck-of-the-loot-box game, not a skill game. :-("", 'The game has nice graphics, and from what I can see maybe also a decent storyline. But truth be told I couldnt even make it out of what I assume is the tutorial mode. The movement controlls are too complicated. Instead of having a free drag movement there should be a way to lock it in place once you touch the screen. And my biggest problem is after every stage there need to be more content to download. I am uninstalling because I simply dont have the space for this ever growing game.', ""The movement in the game is the most frustrating by far. I just started and already, I was disliking how I had trouble moving in the direction I wanted. Also had to restart app a few times just to continue the story. 4 year old game. I expected a bit more. Highly doubt I will continue past the tutorial part of the game, but we'll see."", ""graphics and story are great, but the controls aren't very accurate. I also have a problem with the equipment fusion process where it keeps saying certain equipment is equipped so I can't use them to fuse. but I checked all 5 equipment settings and they're not equipped. also, why are there five equipment settings. then there's the evolution tutorial. running out of space so cant get into it. this could have been a great game, but there are too many glitches."", 'I was expecting way more from playing DH2. Movement is too barbaric. The joystick moves with ur finger so your always moving in different directions or not as fast. Not sure if options can fix it. And the entire platform of different types and more than one (card)? I just wanted to play a mage with update graphics maybe cool ability animations but got thousand diff things to do, bringing about the same old song and dance from other games. Add a bunch of half thought plans, pretend its cool', ""It's fun to play and all. But it's still kinda buggy. I've opened chests just to have the loot get stuck in said chest or near by wall where you can't get it. I've also fought an event boss, spending several portions (those are rare by the way) just to have him teleport through a wall where I can't attack him and he can still attack me. I had to give up. and wasted all those potions."", ""Couldnt get past the intro mission without the game freezing three times. Now when I close and reopen the app it says it cant connect to the internet. Two issues with that. First. My phone is connected to wifi, and I'm streaming a movie off that same wifi no problem. Second. Why do you need to connect to the internet unless I'm in the process of making an in game purchase? Would have liked to llay as it seemed fun, but your game is far too glitchy at this point for me to waste my time."", 'Decided to come back to this because I loved DH4. Not sure if the game isnt optimized for the s10+ or its just the game, but it was super glitchy all the time. Boxes had nothing in them. Destroying objects was a combination of slow motion and ludicrous speed. I got stuck in the floor many times as well. Dead enemies would fly all over the screen in a stretchy rag doll form. Had to uninstall again. Oh Well.', ""Great game. But the lengthy introduction takes me from one mission to the next without a break, I try to explore while I'm doing the missions, but end up getting mission complete and get forced away to next mission before I finish exploring. For first 20 minutes of game, I am forced to choose the actions it directs me to, and not allowed to take a moment to asses my items, equipment, abilities, etc. Need time between missions to organize my character as I see fit. Needs free roam option."", ""The fighting is pretty good, but the levels are too short, and all the other game options make it confusing.. it should be more simple, I don't like to whole fusing items and different elements thing, it gets tiring, you should just be able to find random loot and that's it. Sell what you don't want.. mobile games need to go back to the way console games were, like baldurs gate on ps2"", 'The latest of the long running Dungeon Hunter games is pretty disappointing. I remember playing the first one a long time ago and it was truly a good mobile game along the lines of diablo. Now its devolved into a pay to win game with no real gameplay. All the good items are locked behind loot boxes and require lots of time played or spending real money. The gameplay itself is a side thought and barely requires any actual thought or ability.', ""it advertises itself as a co-op game but you have to get to level 30. this is unfortunate but it's a trend with mobile games and a reason they have a bad reputation. i would love to play a console quality RPG with my fiance but with mobile games being so anti multiplayer it's very difficult. We currently only have one console. i wish a developer would step up and change this. We just do not have the time to jump through hoops to get to multiplayer."", 'It takes up way too much data even to play through the tutorial. The tutorial is way too long. Used up all of my phone data just to get through the tutorial. The controls are wacky and the joystick constantly moves if you move your finger. Overall, not a good game. Stick to Dungeon Hunter 4', ""Great experience but expensive. My absolute favorite hack n slash game ever, far better quality than any of the others. My only gripe with this game is that it is REDICULOUSLY expensive. So far I have fully evolved my set of armor and weapons etc.. but can't master anything to save my life because I never get duplicates for rare items so I'm stuck, and that's with me spending at least 100 dollars and making no progress. Almost makes you want to stop spending because you never get anything."", ""Sorry to have to give this game such a low rating but I had a very serious problem with it. I started playing this game a few years ago and continued playing it periodically and made it far into the levels. Recently though, I tried to play where I left off but my saved progress has been completely deleted. Until this problem is fixed I can't recommend this game knowing you can't keep your progress saved."", ""Game was good to play while it still worked. Played it for almost a year. Every update would introduce more bugs. Update 37 was the last update for me. Game won't start now. Sometimes when it crashes, it would restart my phone. Talked to support, but didn't expect much. Their website says they expect it to crash."", ""There is currently a glitch in game that prevents you from playing. After the tutorial mission, you're prompted to equip the first piece of armor you receive. In that menu, it says to hold the armor to view more details. Pressing and holding does nothing, neither does clicking on the armor or the screen. So new installs are essentially pointless"", 'Can\'t even make it through character creation without this ridiculous nuisance of a pop up notifying me with some nonsense saying to switch accounts and whether I do that or not makes no difference in the slightest because it then proceeds to say ""additional data required to play"" and closes itself out and when loaded back up just sits at a lovely little swirly loading icon and doesn\'t move from there, say like that for 5-10 minutes waiting for it to load but to no avail I\'m left with no game to play because it wants to be retarded. I have played it before and it was great but whatever the hell this is now isn\'t even worth the time or effort to be wasted anymore. Yes I have uninstalled and reinstalled it several times over just for it to repeat its nonsense. Major loss of interest after that.', ""Overall a very simple game. Combat doesn't really have any depth whatsoever. Its just press a button to swing sword or shoot bow and it gets boring very fast. Sure you unlock more skills as you play but you really don't need to use them unless its a boss battle or something of the sort. Gameplay amounts to check what element the boss is, grind for gear that is strong against the boss, then tap attack against the boss while dodging some really easy to dodge aoe attacks. Boring and repetitive."", ""Fun game. Love that class/abilities are dependent of gear and not a choice at the beginning of the game before you know what to even expect from the game. Graphics are perfect for handheld rpg action. Gameplay is smooth even at only 2 bars of 4G service. Don't like that gear can be bought, but also see how it can be attained fo free (just takes a looong time), so... it's worth it for now. The energy/ticket-to-play may bottleneck progress in higher levels, but can't tell yet. Worth a try."", ""I actually can't believe that I wasted my time and space for this app. I thought it looked interesting enough with the gameplay shots in the photos, only to come to find out that not only will it not load the first time you open the app but you also have to go and delete a bunch of apps that ACTUALLY work off your device in order to ATTEMPT to get it to even bring up the download bar in the beginning of it all. Removed indiefently."", 'Can\'t describe game. It freezes in tutorial! Can\'t get game to work. When it comes to see if gear fits, ""tap and hold"" held for 10 minutes, and nothing works. Tried several times. It displays ""cannot back out at this point"" when press device ""back"" button. Please fix so I can play and rate!', 'Horrible, I just downloaded the game 15 minutes ago and it\'s already glitching. I am still in the tutorial where I\'m supposed to get new armor. It freezes there and I can\'t go on and I can\'t skip it. It says, ""tap and hold for more information"" but gives no information and won\'t even let me equip the gear. I had to close out of the game which I\'ve done 3 times now. Pretty bad game if it glitches & freezes before you\'re not even done with the tutorial. Probably going to delete.', ""I've been playing this game for at least 4 years. Recently it has become hardcore p2p and the power creep and imbalances are astounding. Always some new bigger, badder, more expensive toy to get. And each one takes more and more expensive resources that that even more time than the previous one to acquire. It is not fun to play. There are plenty of other games where you can get far more balance and fun for your time and money."", ""Wouldn't load! My sister and I downloaded it but we couldn't get anywhere, not a login screen or character creation. It kept saying there was a connection issue. We both received the same message. My phone works perfectly fine with any other app or game, it's not MY connection that's the issue. We're apparently not the only ones according to some of the other comments."", ""Game is a scam, there was a glitch on a portion of the map on lvl 17, managed to get passed it but contacted customer support about it. After doing so my account was locked out, did some searching and this is a common occurrence after contacting customer support and they won't fix it so if you do play, don't contact them or you will lose your account"", ""I love the game, but all the sudden it won't load. Tried uninstalling and recovering account. It asked me to recover and still won't get past loading screen. U guys need to fix the bug or your about to lose a lot of players, including me! Great game, but if u can't play it, it's useless!!"", ""For the love of !!!!. I understand the benefits of a interactive tutorial but why is it not optional in countless mobile games?? Look. Anyone that has had a phone for over a week knows how the -f- to navigate the maps and overly forced multi-currency virtual item payment screens.. plz stop hijacking the first 5-15 mins of the game... 🤷\u200d♂️ otherwise. The game is great. Couldn't do anything with my character or items for the first 3 missions. So docked 2 stars."", ""Downloaded it twice, first time wouldn't let me choose my person and then got stuck. Second time it took me straight to the same part it got stuck on and still wouldn't move forward (tap and hold to see detail) that is where I got stuck. My friends love this game but I can't play it if I can't even get passed the start."", ""This game only lets you do what it wants you to do. Instead of letting you choose the different menus and play for yourself, it forces your decisions. it makes you equip what they want you do do and then forces your next mission. you can't make a single decision. You have to hit the buttons it wants you to hit between missions. If you have multiple armor or weapons, you can only equip the ones it makes you. what a bad tutorial system. Fix this or it will stay one star for being useless."", ""The game itself is fun... when it actually works. 99% of the time though I get a message upon attempting to load it that it can't connect with the servers, despite every other internet requiring app I have still running perfectly. If this could be fixed, I might rate higher."", 'Good game, controls suck Graphics are decent, story decent, controls are to messy. I\'d rather have a ""click n go"" type of controls. This hold on to a spot and hope he goes that direction and having to release to hit the fight controls isnt an easy task when you are having your arse handed to you in a fight..', ""It has great graphics. I also love how you are aible to just fight monsters to move on to the next level. There's also a thing were you can fight one big wave of monsters to get a special object or jewel like dragons tooth,aciant artafact and lots more. You can get chests to collect gear like swords or armor. It's also cool how you have magic powers and there's a potion that heals you so you don't have to start all over again. Overall it's just a great game. Plus it's just perfect for me. :)"", 'i do 10 rushes on an xp mission and it says something went wrong and just took my last 10 tickets and didnt give me any xp. such a bad time for that to happen. not a fan of that. when that kind of stuff happens...i uninstall or restart...just cant deal with that. im the type of player that needs to get the most of what he has and thats just a shot to the face']",False,"['com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftO2HM', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftD6HM', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftMMHM', 'com.utplus.shadowblood.google', 'com.pancakegames.bw']","['com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA9HM', 'com.gameloft.anmp.sniper.champions', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDMHM', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA8HM', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDOHM']",com.gameloft.android.ANMP.Gloft5DHM,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.Gloft5DHM&hl=en&gl=us

I bought a package that was 19.99 and recieved it, and then an error message popped up and the package(that was marked buy 3 times) changed from 19.99 to 99.99. There were no changes in the package at all . No increases. I don't mind spending money on a good game, but upping the pack price fove times for the same I bought at 20 dollars is frustrating."", ""I am changing to a 1 because the game is so messed up right now!! Won't load lagging and freezing since the last update now you can't even get on the game . It's ashame, ive been playing the game every since it started. Best game online!!! It is a little complicated at first and has gotten very expensive. Very time-consuming and very addictive."", ""Made it kinda far into the game. App kept crashing, so I uninstalled and reinstalled it. Only to not be able to access that castle anymore. Tried to mess around with it to get it back, but the app continued to crash. I gave up on it, and won't take a really long time on a new account, and making a brand new alliance for, I was the leader of my other one. This sucks because I did enjoy this game, until the recurring crashing."", 'Gameloft had a good game...and then over the years have made it worse. In their efforts to make it more balanced and less pay to win they have actually achieved the complete opposite. For example not being able to teleport to enemy lands now means your attacking from a distance. And who is more likely to have a lot of march speed boosts? The spenders.', ""not worth it, it is all about the money. if you don't spend money, I mean lots of money, in the thousands, you have to spend years & many hours to be high level. high levels go around attacking lower levels even if your in alliance. Have to have shields up all the time, but only options are 8, 24, or 3 days. if you are late by a minute you are zero out troops and resources. It takes a long time & lots of resources to get back. Gameloft is not very good at working with you on issues."", ""The first thing hiding the menus from site was very badly placed. Couldn't find anything that I received. Touch anything on the screen takes you to something boarders are to wide .. long waiting to attack something else is definitely wrong in this game.. I could go on and on.. equipment upgrade is still not understandable.. need an info botton to figure that out.. many more things I can't even describe without a video option to send details better...lol.."", 'pay a lot of money. some people have 8-10 castles, buildup and spread out on other teams. then set you up and wipes out your army. the game it self is poorly setup when you select an item to use the items bounce up and down so if you try to just continue to use one item it drops down and causes you to use another item. some of which are very rare or very expensive. it is fun to play but even while small your level 10 and get hit by castles level 20 or even 30. then you start from scratch.', 'very fun and addicting game, great customer care, meet new people from all over the globe. One catch pay to play, its still fun but the game caters to those who have bought their way to the top, also when trying to play the story mode the armies are over 2 million strong no way to beat, unless your a very high level castle, so your wasting time to do all this stuff to finally get to the battle you cannot beat, building times are extremely long over a yr to upgrade a castle, unless...you pay.', 'Nice strategy game. I like the game but some bundles have options that I do not need at all. It would be great if one could substitute items for other items or allow the player to build a bundle. It would be great if the events were spread out some... For example, the Barbarian Assault is over even though it just started one hour ago. Ten hours to go and all the Barbarian Hordes are already conquered. Spread them out throughout the scheduled time window or pick different/rotating days for event', 'The game is honestly really good. Every thing is fairly priced, you never feel like you have to pay anything to progress. Only thing that brings the rating down is the amount of toxic players. No matter your level someone will constantly and repeatedly attack your base. This is an easy mechanic to fix this issue. 1) the play that was attacked is granted a peace shield. 2) Block the ability for higher levels to attack lower level players. Edit: down to one star this game is not worth the time.', 'Absolutely the best castle building game out there. I have played lots but this is the best. I love the city management and political aspects, I just wish Diplomats had more control over managing cities and I wish the leader of the alliance could govern one. and I wish inactive castles could be moved out of the city limits. but those are small issues compared to the overall awesomeness of this game. well done. It actually makes you want to spend money not makes you feel like you have to.', ""The game has a lot of bugs. The chat sometimes doesn't work, the game reboots by itself without warning. Pro: it can link to you PC account so you can play on the go. But your bookmarked locations won't save and some messages will be lost."", 'there needs to be some kind of bracket system that keeps an extremely high level player from attacking a pushover that stands no chance. the developers also need to think outside the box more to make the game more engaging, and tying it in to real history (i.e. age of empires) would be awesome.', 'If you dont mind being thrown off the server every 3 minutes or the game ratching in the sub windows or the loss of texting to communicating. This might be a great game to play. I use 3 different computers with different software platforms, so I know its not at my end. The problems are consistent and the same and now other players have started experiencing it also. Thank you', ""This game was awesome, and never fails to bring you back in but the problem is that there's no way to become strong without money. It takes year's in order to upgrade to level 30 without buying power ups. It would be a better game if it was more fair and doesn't require you to waste your money to rule a realm. This game is only good for the big spenders and cheaters. It's not any fun being unable to defend yourself and become strong without spending hundreds of dollars."", ""So I'm updating my review after playing for a number of years now & no further forward than I was then, this is not a game for moderate spenders, or hard workers, between hackers/bots & wallet warriors you also need to content with Gamesloft who deliberately withhold items to allow you to make decent gear. It's tragic really, but once they think your done spending they forget about old kingdoms & simply open new ones. Don't Start playing, find something fairer if you can."", ""Worst update, we keep. Asking for more fun event and all that the update did was made a longer story that takes more time and 0 extra fun, more challenging story doesn't mean longer, extend the time that takes to completed just make it bored"", 'Fun game for most part, repeatative, same events, same quest, gold easier to earn now. still biggest flaw is pay to play it will take forever to build your castle or you champion without buying items', ""It gets addictive, but after playing for over 2 years, I realise that I only play because of the time and effort I've put in, to get where I am. This game is a rip off, of a preceding game called kingdoms of Cameron, which was great to start with, but ended up like, march of empires."", 'The game has changed so much for the worst. Customer service is very poor with decisions always going their way. Game loft just get greedy and more greedy, with no care for their paying customers. I hope Gameloft enough is never enough for you. Updates are still a fail always causing issues for the consumer. 0 stars', 'Hi GL team, for almost half an hour ago, I have been trying to log into the game. The statement "" online connection failed, please contact customer care"" kept on appearing. Please tell me how to contact customer care, when I couldn\'t even log into the game and I have tried goggle GL March of Empires customer care but no result, please help and in one hour time my shield is going to expire.', 'It is a good game takes a while to upgrade but in the long run its worth it you meet new people it is also fun when you are strong enough to do a real war and fight for the throne but it also takes a long time to do that', 'SPEND NOTHING UNTIL YOU KNOW IT WORKS...I spent 20.00 and cant play it hardley..... ashame because its a really good game...just cant play more than 30 seconds at a time.....and god forbid you message somebody....thats an instant boot offline.....', ""This is the best game I have ever played in my life. I have been playing this game from past 2 years and it's having awesome graphics and many more cool fuctions."", 'Best game . Is like lords of the realm or other similar old games but just way better . This game is very involved, and takes skill and time or money . You dont need to spend cash , its a mistake people make cash will not help most people . learn the game .', ""I had loved playing this game and I was up to a level 32. But I had to get a new phone due to a faulty battery. Trying to download didn't transfer. So I tryed for weeks to contact game loft, How much time and money I had invested and they did nothing to help me. I kept trying & still nothing. I even spent $100. The day before and didn't even use anything off my package a waste. I started a new account for 3rd. Time but won't again. I've spent more than should have on this game, Shame on U GL"", 'The game was getting better. Now we lost members of our Alliance due to the minimum requirements of being changed! Not cool... Not everyone can go out and buy a new device every time Game loft decides to do a update!', ""Wonderful game I have been years on game and liked it till my country ( Syria ) went into civil war. And I was taken to preson after getting freed I lost my mobile phone and health but still breath I tried to link game again but all trys went in vain .massaged you a lot you allow me to re-link it but GL customer care kicked my multi- requests .. if I lost it in my relax I wouldn't send but everyone knows the fken War there .everyone knows people like me had been erased. I need someone's help"", ""My I'd is ddfd8h, I was in realm 406. You admitted to your servers crashing this weekend during merger RvR. My game would load past 80% for 24 hrs. you could have just put up a shield like you do all the time for everyone, as you know there was an issue. instead I lost everything. I lost it do to your error not mine. restore my account for refund me all the money I spent."", ""So I have 1 problem with the game that is so small I barely even care for it, but Im bringing it up, Almost every game like this things like Speed ups and stuff cost way to much, I don't know why but they do, other than that it is a very well built game and I enjoy playing with my Cousin."", ""Too reliant on been online. A month's game play can be wiped out in a minute taking another month to rebuild. Unproportionly biased to stronger players."", ""Why make an Alliance grand adventure event? Extremely hard to achieve, but you advertise your terrible pack to get extra points, what a sick joke GL. Also you give packs to smaller castles with 100's of speed ups for a cheap price but a higher castle gets $160 deals lol with no bargains, you sick people need to stop being so greedy with your scamming mindset."", ""This game has dropped my shield on me 2 times in the last month. My castle has been cleaned out twice. Don't waste your time"", ""Guys. Rectify the login issue. Last few nights I was having this issue. I can't login. Then I goes to bed. And when woke up, my castle was zeroed. I spent a lot on this game bundle. And now this kind of problem made me fed up with this game. Yet today I can't online now. Perhaps later when I sleep I will be zeroed again. What a waste of money I've been spent"", ""Game is good but i really don't understand as to why 1.1GB of space is required for installing a 50-100MB update? It is very frustrating to again and again clear space for update, which becomes mandatory after a while, I really dont need updates if so much space is required every time, i might have to uninstall as updates are so frequent it really annoys. Would have given 4 stars if updates were not mandatory."", 'This game is starting to suck😡😡because of the barbarian assault. This event keeps on coming and destroying the regional buildings and we cant do anything. Please remove this event game team.', 'I find it pathetic that Gameloft says it is a wargame but allows players to tile hit others in lands that are not their own hitting resource tiles is simple terrorist tactics there are low no of troops gathering and you can not send champ with every march so players say give me want I want or I will kill the realm deliberately targeting small players and tiles refusing to hit castles', ""I love this game very match I made alot if friend abd have fun ,but it need nice Internet in poor countries the Internet is bad really bad I can't open it in the evening . so I hope to make updates to make it doesn't have strong Internet"", ""Would give 0 stars, I uninstalled the game for a few days, then reinstalled while my device was still 'linked' and could not access my 6 yr old castle.

There are many bugs and glitches that can be very annoying as well as some features that aren't very good. The game has a lot of flaws that need work. An example of a flaw would be the Engineer and Demolisher classes as they are way too overpowered and the other classes just can't compete. This game is fun but not amazing. It needs a lot of work but it has the potential to be a 5 star game."", 'The game is alright, but the controls are what ruin my experience. The controls are extremely tiny; i keep missing the buttons when I try to tap on them because its just too small. Can you play add an option to change the control size to what players find appropiate and comfortable for their gameplay? I need my controls to be bigger.', 'free to play friendly please. it don\'t make sense why you\'re putting so much money traps for players to accidentally click and forcibly causing the players to lose every bit that they\'ve grinded from matches and hours of ad watching. this game was at its prime back in 2015 but now it\'s like ""hey, wanna get better and make the game boring in a few minutes, buy our stuff"" I remember back when vehicles were free, they were certainly for everyone. It\'s like we\'re paying for a premium service. :/', ""The game would be five stars if only some fixes were applied. Please remove the pay-to-win aspects, make each weapon balanced and fix the freezing issue! No matter what game mode I play, internet or not, the game randomly freezes without a warning and I can do norhing but close the app. Sometimes the game even freezes in the loading screen to a match or it freezes before I can even open it, most of the time it freezes as I'm about to win and I don't get any XP 🥲 using a Samsung Galaxy A 21 s"", 'The game is a whole lot of fun. It kinda reminds me of team fortress 2. The gameplay is smooth and elegant in a mobile game way. I love the variety of gamemodes especially domination, yet capture the flag seems barren and bland. Story mode is not really entertaining, missions are too boring and stale for me to actually continue and sometimes matches are kinda unfair. The game does not have any filter for beginners that can seperate them from veterans. Loading quees are quite long seldomly.', ""I gave this a 4 star and I'm being generous,this game is a great and fun game to play,I was really high level but I lost my account due to some issues. Nevertheless I hop back on because it was a fun game but now it's just so hard to get coins and gems without paying. So your stuck on like bad guns yet you play for ages. Before it wasnt pay to win and yet I had unlocked a lot of the characters. Anyways I hope you can make it easier to obtain currency. This game has a very good potential."", 'Overall a very good game. They should add inspections to all of the weapons and have a good custom interface where by u can make the joystick bigger, so and so. Very good and addicting game.', ""Who thought that reversing the controls for shoot and aim than basically any other game would be a good idea? I tried and tried but could not set my hands on such terrible controls. Furthermore, Gameloft thinks that you're good to go with three presets which are already terrible and some customization like moving your buttons. I want to enlarge them, who can shoot with a 20mm tall and wide button? Seriously? Gameloft? You? Really? I literally started a game with just one person after 3 min wait."", ""I don't like using the smartphone touch screen because it hurts my hand than the orignal game where the pc version is much easy to use. I tried using this game on bluestacks so I can assign the buttons with the buttons on my usb xbox controller or the keyboard to be more easy but the game detected it and banned me for it... They just dont care about the players who has issue playing keyboard or xbox controller. I miss the orignal game on pc. always more fun as I play every day. 2 thumbs down."", 'I remember the good old days of this game, a much better experience, with a big amount of players, now I see hackers and 5000 hour players everywhere i go. Of course, in classic gameloft fashion, everything is paid, even the flipin\' characters. Oh, and don\'t tell me the classic ""We just needed money"" ; if you want money, make a tolerable game, and people will be more happy with it and will want to invest more money into it.', 'I used to play the HELL outta this game, and frankly, i loved it at the age of 8, still do, but more through rose tinted glasses now. The servers are now ghost towns, and wow, no one is on, even on a good day. and people can just stack wipe you from merely glancing in your direction, which not to pay mind to, awfully overpowered and expensive weapons these people use i miss you old blitz. im not sure what they did to you, or if people moved on, but i hope things get better in your future.', 'It something however the control is bad. The experience is bad. The graphics is good tho but the way the game feel is just off like a lot. The mechanic of the gun and movement is good however the mode in the game just does not feel right. If the game mode is a bit like COD it would be amazing. And pls remuv some pay to win stuff it just make the game unplayable. Fix the control too.', 'this game is very good but gameloft needs to work more on this game or make a blitz brigade 2 because then they could stop the pay to win, remodel characters make new weapons and maps that have much better quality since in my opinion the game looks like some 1998 game. but blitz brigade in general is still a good game but not up to date so i think they should make a blitz brigade 2 because the game now is good its fun to play but new players dont see it like that they leave because it looks bad', ""It is the best game I've ever played but the one thing I really hate is repairing the weapons. I had to watch an ad just to have enough coins to repair the weapon. The coins should be used on the Fusion. I suggest to remove the Repair button because the Demolisher takes a whole lot of fat stack of coins."", ""This game I was loyal to, really enjoyed it. One problem that made me uninstall this is you're. Going. To. Lose. Your. Account! I used to play this on an iPad which was fun. I tried to link this with my phone.. Nothing! I was sooooo LIVID! I've really spent YEARS on the 1st acc it but I moved on and started again built my progress but not as close as the first time and still lost everything AGAIN Support team never emailed me back so I just deleted it. Thats my take on it. Best of luck 2 your$"", 'I extremely loved this game and play it everyday. This is better than pubg or cod or battlefield or csgo. Only ramp up the anti cheat. Give the game a few needed updates. Those complaining of pay-to-win in this game are simply noobs. There are many events where you can get weapons and diamonds. The problem is hackers and invincible players.', 'Terribly unbalanced. Zero point in playing if you are coming into this as a new player. Weapon decay is a pointless feature that is just another layer of grinding in this already pay to win game. You can dump a full magazine of ammo into another players head at close distance and not kill them, but literally die from a single one of their hits. This is overall bad game design for a pvp shooter and obviously causes massive imbalances in player power level.', ""At first it was a really enjoyable game, until now. When you open a crate during a game, you may get away with opening one but when you open a second one it will freeze you and you need to restart. Same goes to the special power of the ninja, you may use it for 3 times but that's rare, when you try your 3rd time it also freezes you"", ""Fix stuttering. It seems that every time a new player joins the game the screen freezes momentarily and by the time it unfreezes you've been shot up or you've missed a good shot. Minor things to be fixed about this game in order to be near perfect. Also add new maps. Same maps for like five years now lol."", 'I have played this game before and it was really good and fun but with the recent update s, everything is literally pay2win. I downloaded the game to play it again after a while but I ended up deleting it after 4 matches. Rich players can kill you within a blink of an eye while it takes you almost forever to kill them. They can just buy loads of medkits and heal automaticly even when they are being shot. The more you spend the better you get, nothing is based on skill anymore. They ruined it.', 'The gameplay was good but the controls are so tiny and the jump button is a tiny rectangle in the bottom corner which makes it really hard to play. I searched the control settings and found no way to make the buttons bigger in anyway. Other than that it is a pretty good game', ""The game is great, except for two problems, balance and a report system. Due to all these weapons being overpowered there is basically no balance, which is not my biggest problem, for it is the lack of a report system. The game is becoming slowlyess and less fun for me because of people who spawn camp. Why play if you can't win because campers with OP weapons won't let you do anything? You should be able to report and get rid of them."", ""The game used to be good. Now it is definitely pay to win. Either you can buy the top weapons and powerups and instant respawn or you get bodied. The matchmaking is terrible, there aren't even enough players to have a decent match, and it will often put you in the same match you just tried to leave. Some of the classes are just broken and op. There is consistent lag that ruins the game. Don't waste your storage space."", 'This game used to be the best. I used to play it everyday, back in the day. But ever since that upsate that added the 2 characters that you have to pay for the game became terrible. Now its just pay 2 win. Last time i played it was like a year ago and it was horrible. I dont plan on ever coming back unless gameloft does something and reverts those updates.', ""graphics are good but the game play controls need work, The firing botton should not have to be a fight to just shoot someone or the gun itself. Fun gameplay but horrible controls. other games that have not updated there UI in years an it's flawless how does this game get it so bad. But I bet this game will do little to nothing to change it an app is just made to get money. but if it ever gets updated I will return."", ""A very good game. It's amazing the gameplay is amazing and addictive. I first gave this game 5 stars but I changed it to 4. I have noticed that whenever my team is losing , they often leave in the middle of the match. It's very annoying and the worst part is that they don't get punished. I once had to play a 1 Vs 4 match in this game and I got trashed. There should be some sort of punishment for people who do that. It takes the fun out of the game"", ""Good game but the control layout customizations(CLC) is garbage. I use four fingers to play my games and this game is forcing me to use two thumbs and the area where the aiming and shooting are bundled with features to add on to are sometimes pressed by mistake when you don't need them. I wish they could take examples of CLC form games like Pubg mobile or Call of duty mobile or critical Ops or even apple knight."", ""This was by far the worst gameloft game I've played. The controls are super buggy, and with the auto aim, this game takes no skill. lobby's that should be 6v6 are only 2v2, and the graphics are garbage. I thought maybe this game improved from before, when you couldn't even play it, but honestly, it is worse. Dont play this if you enjoy games"", ""It's a really nice concept just lacking players and I can see why At first it's fun but then the game starts to add 3-4 players per match (adding players from both teams) which makes it boaring to play and the game even starts to add players when match is almost ended I have been defeated without playing many times and the the vehicle equip options are not very clear+it shows a compulsory add before every match which is irritating"", ""So i leveled up and after a long time of saving i couldn't wait to finally buy this weapon, but i accidentally clicked and bought this worthless weapon. It costed me a lot of money and i knew it would take a lot of time to earn my money back again. Just so other people don't experience the same thing can you maybe put like a warning before somebody else clicks and immediately buys a weapon by accident too? (I know you wont listen to me but just in case you do pls do that.)"", ""Its not working! Im so sorry but im giving this game a star cuz it didn't work for me And it kept leaving the app automatically. I was really excited to try it but i didnt even get to play a thing because all i got was a black screen. I also tried uninstall and install the app but that didn't work either! please fix this! I really want to try this game. And there are alot of reviews facing the same issues so i would really like it if the situation was handled."", ""To start off, the graphics are easily rivaled with that of Mega Man X7... Second, good luck trying to find players in this game. It's a 1 in 15 chance.... This game also is Gameloft's attempt at a TF2 clone. Not gonna lie, I was interested. Until I noticed YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR SOME CLASSES! THAT IS ONE THING I DESPISE! ITS LIKE HAVING TO PAY A TOLL BOOTH, BECAUSE YOU DONT GET ANYTHING SPECIAL! IT JUST LETS YOU PLAY USING NEW CLASS MECHANICS!"", 'I like it but every time during the game it exits me out of the game and takes me to home screen and i dont like that. I keep launchin back in the game but it just does the same thing over and over again. i would rate it 5 stars if u can fix it so it wont keep exiting me back to home screen. plz help me bro really i love the game but i cant play it if it does that. fix it plz.😧😠😡😦😕😣😣😣👈👌', ""Unbalanced and you'll be matched with higher ranks and overpowered character. Very unfair to newbies. They can shoot you from a far and hit you instantly in the head. Maybe that's the reason why they're only three players in a match. No one wants to play anymore. Shame because the game kinda good."", 'When I played the game it didnt gave me a tutorial and the buttons are so small. I only play 1 match and I uninstalled it. Graphics are fantastic. The game has lotes of potential so I rat it 3 stars. Stay safe or 2020 devil will get you😈!', ""I used to love this game, but since there was a new update with some changes I was a bit disappointed. Some of these things include: -having to buy your own vehicle to use in a game -only one person can be in a vehicle which are meant to be for two people such as car I got alot of things to write here on my list but i won't have enough time... So, please bring back the last update where you don't reaally have to buya vehicle instead they put it in a game for free to be used..."", ""I just can't believe how garbage the settings are. 3 control options that are all basically the same. WHY you can't have a custom botton lay out to put your move and shoot bottons where you want is beyond me. Even PubG mobile knew enough to do that. Not to mention the ads they throw in your face here..."", ""My childhood favourite. Only got one problem - Gameloft doesn't seem to be doing anything to fix the errors and in game glitches. Please work on it. I was forced to re install the game because of the error 'disconnected from server'"", ""I love this game, ive been playing it since day one. but ever since that new role came out(the one that has the land mines and stuff) the game seems to have slowed down, so please revert the game to its former glory in what we may call a 'DownDate' (instead of UpDate) to what it was in the year 2013"", ""Game is too good to be a MESS. Terribly shaky gameplay, too much movement when running and there's no auto fire on crosshair. Shoot button is not needed. GUNS OF BOOM is perfect and better.

com.gameloft.android.ANMP.dark.heroes.strategy.games,Heroes of the Dark™: RPG Game,"Vampire, Werewolf, and Human: In this age of darkness, these three factions wage a bloody war for dominance and survival. Choose the faction that you want to embrace.

Heroes of the Dark (HotD) is an online game set in a grim Victorian world full of lands to explore, mysteries to uncover, and monsters to vanquish. But to do this you must recruit and train heroes of darkness from each faction - for only one who can master their combined magic and might in 5v5 battle can prevent the darkest of fates from befalling the land of Tenebris.

<h1>Strategic RPG 5v5 Battle</h1>
It is not enough to simply amass great heroes to your side. HotD offers a deep level of strategy as you form teams for fast-paced 5v5 battle, utilizing dozens of unique Werewolf, Human, and Vampire heroes. Discover synergies between your heroes of darkness and their classes to outwit enemies and unleash unspeakable magic and devastation!

<h1>Strategy Battle & Forbidden Magic</h1>
When the moon shattered, its shards rained upon the world, granting the Werewolves untold strength. So the Vampires fled to Tenebris, bending it to their self-righteous will. But the Humans they rule have forged great technology in hopes of overthrowing their masters, just as the Werewolves have tracked the Vampires to this land.

<h1>A Multiplayer Vibrant Online Game</h1>
The action never stops in HotD! Because this is a real time online game, your might grows and the world evolves even as you sleep. You can send heroes to explore a dungeon now, and check back later to see what treasures they’ve found. And be sure to watch your allies’ backs to fend off unexpected attacks.

<h1>Customize Your Mansion</h1>
You will begin your strategy RPG adventure from within a gothic mansion, filled with dark magic waiting to be unlocked. As your power grows, you can expand your mansion to allow more heroes of darkness to unite from the Human, Werewolf and Vampire factions. 

<h1>Connect with Friends & Allies</h1>
As you forge mighty alliances with other HotD players, you can wage all-out alliance wars, vanquish your rivals in 5v5 battle, and rise to legendary renown. By working together, you can even claim whole regions, capture magic Crystals, and ultimately assault the Heart of Tenebris - the key to mastering this online game.

Heroes of the Dark is available in 12 different languages: English, Русский, Español, Deutsch, Français, Português, Italiano, العربية , 한국어, 中文简体, 中文繁體 and 日本語

Lots of grinding to level characters but also lots to do. Story is slow due to having to grind so much but entertaining nonetheless. Graphics are simple but nice. Shop prices are standard for the genre but not really necessary if you have a little patience. I like the ability to relocate your base and the crystal system, which gives you a little control over what you choose to level."", ""I loved this game in the beginning but it's become very frustrating after awhile. I don't mind grinding in games but this one is not very rewarding. I've been trying to get one character that I love for months but the drops from the portal haven't given me anything. I'm disappointed because this game has beautiful graphics and I love the story, but it shouldn't be so difficult to earn special characters in events and the portal."", ""It's gorgeous and has tons of potential, but is quickly turning into being EXTREMELY slanted towards paying players. There doesn't seem to be an actual endgame, the midgame is a SLOG, the developers are extremely cagey about updates and what's being worked on, and the issues keep piling up. I would love to revisit this rating and bump it to five stars, but I don't see that happening while money is clearly more of a goal than player enjoyment or satisfaction."", 'Buggy, a lot of grinding. I like the game overall. It looks good and the story is decent. Yes, you will grind a lot, but I think of that as more of a feature than a bug & you can always pay to go faster. Maybe not ideal, but pretty standard. What makes it 3-star game is that the game breaks everytime they do ""maintenance"". Today, is the 3rd time I\'ve been unable to connect despite still getting the push notifications from them. Its a terrible experience.', ""A very fun game in the beginning. Storyline is interesting but then becomes extremely fragmented as you spend countless countless hours grinding to get your characters and mansion high enough to continue it in bits and pieces. Highly structured for Pay to Play, which I am not against but every log on involves one or two ads telling you to buy this pack or that pack...that I am against. The game becomes monotonous fast and if you spent hundreds of dollars, that wouldn't change that fact."", ""In my opinion this is a great idea for a game it's an excellent blend of gotcha hero building and territorial conquering strategy game. And some of the hero designs are really neat there's some depth to the character builds and the graphics look really good. But once you try and scratch a bit deeper into the surface it is a very slow and grinding game, more so than others of this genre. all of the in-game purchases are not worth the asking price, On top of lots bugs and glitches makes it a wait"", 'Has potential, but has the most annoying feature I have ever seen in a game. Any time you send a team on a mission, when they you have 3s to hit the tiny opt out button or you are sucked into the sloooow fight, losing whatever else you were doing. Setting up your squad to go hit that lvl 8 nuker camp you found after scrolling around on the map? Oops, going to have to find it again, you missed your window. Need to switch that to ""click to opt IN to view,"" add double speed combat, and save lineups', 'Its a slow grind game with a ""wait and see"" approach. That is, you send your people out and then wait and see what they do. You can only watch them. Very little strategy beyond initial positioning and giving them gear. But the auto gear option is dumb. It will prioritize health regen over crit chance or crit damage. And there is a bug in Catacombs where if a teammate dies, your game crashes after picking a replacement. I reported it but they don\'t fix it.', ""Meh, just another cookie-cutter gatcha-PvP-dungeon crawler with that awful energy system and a modest P2W mechanic (though it's not that bad, comparatively speaking). What turns me off is the unimaginative mish-mash and mangling of vampire and were lore it's founded on. The graphics are great, but there's not much variety in te characters or tasks or events, and it ends up getting old very soon. Like an M&M on a hot day, it's pretty on the outside and gunk on the inside."", ""Well, I want to give the game a 5 star rating, but everytime I play the game glitches really bad and it kicks me out and says trying to astablish connection and it happens when I'm attempting to attack an enemy camp and it sent somewhere else and I almost started a war. I'm letting you know this so you can fix it. Thanks"", ""Not the best game but decent haven't played much so far, I'm sure it's a cash grab like all the other apps, has the old energy, rinse wash repeat garbage I hate but finally a game where u can play as a monster!!! It's so rare, also wish there was an option to skip the tutorial, I hate hand holding but glad it wasn't to long, but I understand it's necessary for people that have never played a game before"", 'Has potential in the FUTURE. But it won\'t happen. No real game play. Always auto fighting.. Only a ""sort of"" city builder, shard collector, gotcha, and pay to reduce time... it would take a year to gain decent heroes. Cannot control anything during a fight, and that is the part the messed up on. Everything else would be fine if there was some content that was enjoyable, but the ""auto fighting"" took any possibility away from this game. Unless they implemented something enjoyable, it won\'t survive', ""The animated graphics are awesome when first launching and downloading! I had some trouble opening after the additional file download (800+mb). It seem to of hung on Google Play Game The game feels familiar to me a couple different ways like a mesh up of games I played in the past. It's really hard to start playing as a new player when there are players at level 19 mansions who have been playing for three or more weeks. To add to the difficulty there is a strong pay to win (P2W) initiative."", ""I really enjoyed this game for a short time. However, you can't really progress on the map unless you're in a sizable guild and even then they require you to play everyday. I don't have time for that. This game leans more into guilds than solo to progress and there aren't any vampire/werewolf games out there worth playing. Otherwise, it's a fun game."", ""I see MUCH potential in this game. They DEFINITELY need to allow server choosing/transferring of some sort as soon as possible. I was hoping to try this game with my friends but there is no option. Next: The number of heroes in the game is quite low even for an initial launch, it will lack diversity quickly. Lastly, hero summons should have a chance at giving full hero, not just shards. It's too expensive as is. I hope to return and try the game again in 2 months and see if things improve."", ""I wish I could give this a higher score. It does get style points since there is a distinct lack of vampire themed games on the Play Store but ultimately this is a paint-by-nunbers clone of a game you've played a bunch of times before. Bunches of people on the map, your mansion (city) has a shield that eventually expires and people raid your resources while you're sleeping. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't super disappointed with this one."", ""So the fights you just watch you don't get to participate in and that just seems wrong to me. The screen always freezes when it changes its your basic shelter building game nothing engaging. The graphics are really well done at the end of the day though its basic and disingenuous to what you are getting from the ads"", 'Rather dull and unimaginative. Normally starting a brand new game is easy to keep me interested. Instead I found myself struggling to want to play. It takes a lot of talent to make vampires boring. The game screen is bloated with messages. Copy paste ideas that are aimed at making a quick buck rather than keeping people interested long term. Gameplay offers nothing new and oddly enough the things designed most to wrest your time simply fail entirely. The art style lastly is unappealing. It fails', 'Should require stamina to attack an occupied mine. Auto translate option or move translate buttons out from behind scroll bar. Optional profanity filter, it bleeps the word ""shoe"". Dungeons for every hero. Add new heroes of every rarity instead of just epic and legendary. Unequip all button or the ability to select catacombs difficulty.', ""Completely pay to win. The new features are underwhelming: •search function only works half the time, and usually sends you back to something you've already fought •New bosses are pointless unless you're at end game, its actually a waste of stamina for such a tiny reward, which is less reward than just using the same stamina in camps. Waste of data mechanic •changing stamina gains in rewards has massively nerfed progress •catacombs 3 weeks and counting with no clear because scaling is too high"", 'Too busy collecting gold to upgrade castle which is a downer - so expensive. Something wrong with game, cannot change my avatar name & cannot talk to any guild members. Yeah, 3 things I found with this game. Why is it so expensive to upgrade castle $3.3 mil to make lvl 20, so it takes a couple of days to mine that much gold, waste of players time.', ""Could be a very nice game but well... it's not. It's hard enough to upgrade and gear and etc 5 heroes, but they force you to use different heroes which increases the difficulty and time required by many times. Also you dont get full heroes on pulls so good luck upgrading that many heroes to full stars."", ""Great strategy game, easy to learn. My guild is full of people who don't pay and are strong. Paying doesn't make you immortal without knowledge of the game. You have to actually learn how to build a proper team. Only complaint is to have dead accounts removed after like 30 days of inactivity. Only request is to usher in a new monster type. I'm think magical users such as witches, warlocks, mages, shaman, etc. . I do like there aren't an excess of characters but that would take it up a level."", ""I was going to give 5 stars, more if I could, cuz the game is great! BUT since the update I can't play because I'm constantly kicked out then it won't connect, when it does guess what....KICKED OUT AGAIN!!! Please fix this issue so I can go back to enjoying this game. ***EDIT***The game worked not too long after this review and has been awesome!! This latest update with its new features has made it even better!!!! My Heroes are strong, our guild is strong, this game is great! So, 5 stars now!"", ""This isn't like any other game iv played its well balanced as far as not pay to win like most. Through the events you can easily gather all types of currency etc as always you can pay for different things faster but overall I'm still able to enjoy the game and not spend a fortune to do so"", 'UPDATE goes to 2*. The issue not even were solved, but after last updates, it is not possible to play - game crashes after 5 sec. Tried several times to reinstall. Without sucess. 3* goes for good game. The only thing that really sucks is, you have to reset your phone each time you do the changes insquad during the participation in cathacombs. And for support line - it is useless - no reaction at all.', 'I love the game, but since this morning I am not able to log into the game. It goes to 4% and crashes. Was working at 9AM perfectly normal and just stopped aroud 11. Ive tried to switch from wifi to cell and event restarted the device couple of times. I hate the fact that I was top 70 in event that gives platinum as reward and I really need it in order to grow b4 gate 7. Please fix it asap.', ""I Adore the Game but your missing Fictures such as when the characters rank up they should get upgrade like amour or spells even some features of the characters can change whilst they Rank and Star Up also in the Catacombs their needs to be a auto button so you don't need to press the next place to go and it does it for u maybe we can even leave the catacombs whilst still letting the game play in the back ground so you can carry on killing the bandits ??"", 'I love the original styling of game play in heroes of the dark. All functions of the game are smooth. Thank you for a game ,which I think is different from other strategy games in many ways.', 'Only game on the phone that will not download the update. Setting allow for download over any network but the game still says it has to be downloaded over wifi. My last review was met with a comment from gameloft about settings not allowing mobile download, but, all other apps and games are fine.', ""One of the worst games. It started out decent but constantly gets worse and worse the longer you play. There is zero customer service! They keep making new servers because the game is dying and they need to sucker new people who don't know any better. I advise everyone to find a better game. It's not hard. But this one isn't worth it"", 'Really beautiful art in my opinion. The gameplay is okayish. Not many different features than other games of this type. But I hope in the future the existing heroes get more diversity. Like different ways to develop the heroes. Awakening tree where you can awaken your hero with several options for example. And if you connect this to an NFT you will be really ahead of the curve', ""The gameplay, audio graphics is good. But the game needs lots of improvement. It needs filter ans sort system. You can not sort heros based of particular categories, you can not filter or find camps of particular elements. Was hoping a quality game from Gameloft. The game I would say very mediocre till now. Let's see if we see new things in next updates. If not, the game's gonna die very soon."", ""I love this game. I really do. But most of that is due to the community. There are so many aspects missing that help with the running of an alliance. We desperately need this added. Like messaging all members at once, seeing who is contributing or not. It adds more of a team rivalry element thats currently missing. We can't share resources which is again a team element thats missing. Emoji would be fun but not essential but should be noted that it's really wanted. There are so many more things"", 'The game itself, I love. And would get 5 stars from me BUT for 3 things. There should be some sort of cap or cool down on players being attacked. AND every single hero collector I\'ve played has a ""favorite"" tag so all your favs are at the top of the list, except this one. You have to look for your favorite. It\'s tedious and is a QoL feature that should be an automatic given in a game like this. But it doesn\'t have one. Also, instead of attacking mansions PVP should be my heroes vs others heroes', 'This isn\'t a game! It is both boring and pointless. I literally made 2 in app purchases, saw everything ""level up"" as you\'d put it. And it instantly strangled the not game. Trying to force me to make another in app purchase, if I wished to continue with the boredom. Over a decade I can\'t believe Gameloft are still going when all they make is slowed down strangled unless you pay garbage. And that will be all I think of Gameloft from now on!', 'Very strong carrot on a stick, way too heavy handed. 6 energy every hour is extremely slow, considering how much of it you need just to farm basic resources. Not even a decent time waster, as there is nothing to do while your energy comes back. Very beautiful graphics, shame that it is wasted on this.', 'Was a good game while it lasted. It is F2P but to compete you will need to invest $$ or so so many hours of your life and in some cases not sleep. I played on an old server before global. Was one of the top players without spending. We got to the heart and nothing. That was it. New OP heroes to open your wallets. But end game is about 6months in. New servers will find out later on. Got boring and tedious to level up heroes. Whole day grinding and get few levels for main team.', 'A lot of fun. Good in game diversity, gear classes etc. Also your clan can help you with building improvements at no cost. very interesting!', 'Nice game, decent look and interesting characters etc, but I am so frustrated by the bugs.. Virtually everytime I go into the map, the game stops.. Have tried everything from clearing cache, lowering resolution etc but nothing helps..

I know the ins&outs of every map, every character, every weapon. I used to be able to match and play a game any time of the day. Nobody plays anymore. You'd be lucky to match and play against a live team. Gameloft never updates the game, they don't change the free character rotation, they don't come out with new characters anymore. You're better off finding a different game where people actually log on."", 'The controls take getting used to because well....its just that old of a game. Sadly a prime example of a poor handled game. As time went on people seemed to realize Gameloft had no idea on how to actually manage a MODA sadly. Was still fun nonetheless. New characters were stupidly op or basically useless, the decision to add full blown ads for random products in login and lobbys. If I remember correctly its been over 4 years since an actual update.', 'Veteran player, played during my University years and really enjoyed the gameplay, mechanics, development, and content. Logging back in after 4-5 years, unable to recover my previous account, lobbies taking long time to fill, and the sudden crashes. I hope the developers are taking this game seriously and i hope for a fast fix for the crashes.', ""It was the best game I ever played before, even though there's similar games now. It had the most unique part in champs, their traits and skills. Well the point, why I gave only 1 star is cause of, 5 years ago a new update made the game impossible to play. Cause of bugs, bad connection and game collapse. It's just impossible to play and just staying on front side. Well I tried to play it a few months ago, but it didn't change much. If it didn't collapse i would have given 2-3 stars."", 'The game is awesome and unique on its own way but the devs itself abandoned the game, such a shame. But it would be a good choice if you make an HO&C 2 with better controls and graphics also the connection and stability of the game with a device. I like the map, heroes and graphics. Just a little enhancement of graphics is enough and further improve the controls sometimes it feels clunky. But it was a good game.', ""I used to love this game, but now I hate it, it's so laggy, I wasted my time installing this and downloading the resources, why do I have to wait 30 minutes for a 5 minute match? The heroes are hard to control, the controls of the game doesn't match on mobile phones, it looks like DOTA 2, but the gameplay is awful. EDIT: The game has now improved, it's not laggy anymore, but I still have to wait 30 minutes for a 5 minute match."", 'I enjoyed this game 4 to 5 years ago and i downloaded it again today and it was harder to play since i have a bigger hand and it is also hard to control like the skill shots. It is also hard to control the camera. I just feel like this game would have a chanve to shine if the controls are more different like the controls on wild rift but you can just toggle that on and off and the skill shots too you need to drag the skill on the middle of the screen just to cast it.', ""This game app is living under a rock and super outdated. The instructions are so annoying and beginners would get so confused of what's going on. And the downloading resources intro took many minutes and upon entering, we gotta choose either world or asia like wt heck was that? isn't this game global? or it doesn't determine where the downloads came from? just add another option : global ( which would both find teammates from Asia to the whole universe) & don't let us choose with 3 heroes only."", 'It crashes and has a bug on reconnect sometimes..And specially when playing with other players.And for a pvp game , stability is critical.If the issue be solved, it can be easily a 4 or 5 star game. I am sure this bug has killed the game, dropping without any reason and failing in reconnection,it reconnects but on synchronization it crashes again and again , mo chance to join after such a drop. Also you will be punished for getting dc! And worse is the fact that seems nobody looks comments here', ""What the hell is this crappy gameplay? The characters are too slow to respond, there's no problem with my net them why is each character responding 0.5 to 1 second after I move them somewhere? Fix your servers. Also the skills are not aiming properly, they are stuck at some angles and wouldn't go there, I have to change my whole location to just aim the skill. Really bad experience. 1 star is deserving."", ""Horrible experience, littered with adverts. Adverts on every screen and intrusive full screen pop ups that you must watch for minimal time to proceed. Really interfered with trying to play the game. All modes are locked until you're level 10,need to queue 5 minutes just to play vs computer. What??"", ""Haven't even started the game and already very annoyed the with name selection. They are very strict on the characters, all must be lower cased. Every name is taken, literally have to come up with some bs with numbers behind it just to get started. Give the players more flexibility in characters for the names. Or clear out some of the inactive user names so we can get decent names crying out loud."", 'i just can\'t give this a positive review. the controlls are clunky as hell and its single tap recognition meaning u can\'t walk and use skills at the same time. it seems to me the game is stretched on my screen ( maybe it\'s just my device bc i have 6.2"" screen) the graphics aren\'t the best or the cleanest. minimap may as well be gone its to small to recognize anything and i have a large screen and good eye\'s. on the plus side the tutorial is alright. can\'t recommend this game.', 'There are two annoying flaws that I would like to see fixed. First is the inability to cancel casting spells, which makes me waste spells that I accidentally press. Second, spell targeting starts at the right hand of the screen, therefore making it harder to target enemirs in front of the screen', ""Ok, at first I was seriously mesmerized by the map's graphic it was insane, but after my first match I instantly regret everything and uninstall it, first of all, bug everywhere, control problem, there's no one play this game and it's hard to find a team and once you find it it's either someone trolling or a bot, and threfore you have to go trough a really long queue, it's just not worth to download,"", 'I spend $15USD and the game is not working at all. At 1st it did, now it say ""Request Time Out, check connection or try later"". I\'m connected to a high , fastest internet, next to Fiber. So I know it\'s not on my end. Is there a fix to this??? If not, I\'ll report this to my bank as fraud. A service I was never provided for what I paid for. I look forward for this issue to be fix for future gamers won\'t get hurt. If fix, I\'ll add more stars Best regards', ""this game was by far the best game I have ever played until they did the big update and changed how the graphics looked. I think that's the main reason why a lot of people stopped playing. I decided to give the game a chance but it hopeless because trying to get into a match is literally impossible"", 'Well, the design is quite awesome but the gameplay or I must say the movement is not as smooth as other moba and the equipments should be available anywhere or there must be a recommendation. More improvement and it will be awesome!', 'This used to be my favorite game when I was a kid. I think I played it consistently for 5 years everyday, it was so fun. The best part about it for me as a kid was unlocking the more expensive heroes like Frotzel and Persephone. But now when I try to log back in its unplayable. The games pretty much dead. No player base, bad servers, I think they even havent changed the free rotation since 2016. RIP heroes of order and chaos will always have a place in my heart..', ""Absolutely love this game. Absolutely amazing graphics. The only thing is that ive now bought two different things, and everytime I try to collect them, I get a loading screen and then it asks me to sign in again so I do. Only I don't get what I purchased."", 'The whole game is awesome! The graphics, the characters and the controls but why every time I play with another player online, the app keeps on crashing even though the signal is so strong? Please fix it, thanks.', ""The game looks wonderful but the controls are odd and the lag is TERRIBLE. I couldnt even play one game, I was lucky if i could manage to force the 'hero' to the enemy team. Also, you dont need to know my location, that info should be optional."", 'This used to be a great game now, it has tons of ads. Graphics sucks. A ton of bugs and crashes. I cant believe I just wasted my data for downloading the updates and packages. I couldnt even play it. It keeps on crashings every match loading.', 'I used to play this game back in 2012 (7 years ago!) when it was still in its prime. It was actually the best there was on play store. It was better than VG in my opinion back in the day. I had no problem with the controls and whatsoever everything about the game was so fun, addictive, and competitive. And I really loved it back in the day. Such a shame that this game is dead now. I hope gameloft makes it alive or make another awesome moba like this one. Itwas unique 7 years ago.Gameloft step up', ""I started this game when it first came out. It has potential but the developers never really update and fix the bugs. Similar issues years later. Don't waste your money, it's a shame because I like the game too. That's lost revenue and users for you. Fix the bugs like the wifi one. Even though I have a solid connection it'll disconnect saying no wifi. I can't even get my experience making it a huge waste of my time."", 'Sorry for everyone who kove this game. I gave it a 2 because in my device, the tutorial was smooth but when it came to connecting accounts, it just doesnt connect, even when I play as quest the loading never stops until it reaches zero. Even when my internet signal is strong it just doesnt respond Pls fix this', ""Very very disappointing..At first I thought map's graphics would be cool,but it's all fake.The graphics were not proper,heroes were even not visible..and always loading n claiming ''you have a bad network connection please try again later ''.Oh please!! How many times I checked my net work it's was fine all the time..don't install it please..not worth for installation."", 'Years ago, this game used to be the finest of all mobile MOBA games. As years came by, Gameloft just neglected this game and just left it to rot. Ads are just infesting the app, graphics are outdated, there is a huge lack of nee updates and features, and crashes frequently occur. The amount of storage data is not worth spending anymore with this game. Such a huge dissapointment.', 'This game was a great game years ago. The last time I played, I installed this app onto my new phone. Upon logging in on a new device, all my data was reset. My level, skins, and heroes were all gone. The account was still fine but everything else was reset. Was fun while it lasted I guess...', ""Guys I had a problem in your game. I can't finish my game when playing co-op game . It's logging and then I start again playing. Then it's shows synchronizing. And also shows I'm not connected. Please fix😥😥😥 I'll give it perfect five stars. It's a good game. So pleassssse."", 'Well this game would have possibly got 5 stars but everytime I log in and try to start a game it takes forever to get into a match and also when I finally do get into a match when I have full service on both wifi and data the game disconnects me and then I try and reconnect and it continues to disconnect me . So horrible laggy game fix your servers and or delete this game immediately .', ""Horrible game, honestly i was really excited to try this game because everyone in the comments were really hyping it up. Ultimately i caved and tried it out and it was the worst experience ever(EVER) the controls are bad and you don't have the option to change them, heros are unbalanced, WAY TO MANY BOTS. Overall not good I get that its suppost to be like LoL and Dota but i fell short in way to many places. The only good thing was the graphics (kinda depending on settings)"", 'horrible game. graphics seem good but with crappy controls and gameplay it means nothing. This game seems fun and harmless but it isnt. if you have an older phone do not instal. if your phone gets hot DO NOT INSTALL! If you are on a limited data plan or have a data Cap do not install. this game uses data in the background and a lot of it without you knowing.', ""Once upon a time it was a great game. Now gameloft doesn't even care about it. If you log in with facebook, has tons of ads. (Make a gameloft account to avoid this) No new heroes in like 2 years. No advertising so player base is completely dying out. Really disappointed after all the time and effort I put into reaching lvl 40 and unlocking all heroes. Fun mode is AMAZING yet can't even find 10 people to play due to Gameloft's neglect. But I'll be here until they shut it down. ~saintnick313"", ""Installed it to relive my childhood memories but your internal servers sucks so much that i can't even log in after playing tutorial. If you guys don't even bother fixing the servers, might as well just delete the whole game from the store and not waste other people's time."", 'Cant access asia server.. the game has a potential but.. the controls are hard to use specially if you chase a enemy your character suddenly turning back the controls are not user friendly and has a lame layout finding match takes too long all l players come and go so you wait much longer to have a single game', ""I love every thing about this game, peaple argue about control but it's ok becouse its diffrent from other game, but when you handle it it is good. To the devs, there is no moba game like HOC , it is still the best, we dont want any heroes, just bring back the events and fix free weekly heroes and make the ranks go on. The people love it when there is rank. We can fight eachother through it. Fix the crashing part also."", 'The game is really fun when u get a chance to play it, the character mechanics are awesome but for some reason my game just crashes whenever I play and I cant even get in a match. Even when i do not crash which is like inevitable it takes a couple hours to que a match.', ""For me this is the best pvp ever. Better than mobile legends, the down side is that the app crash everytime and cause the players to stop playing anymore. I love how the characters they where uniquely made one by one, it's just that the app crash everytime. Not everyone has a broad patience"", ""Seems like a good moba.

I played it many years ago and recently found it again. However I'm giving it 1 star because the ads were shutting down the app. I would exit out of the ads and it would say website not found written over my village and would freeze it until I restarted the app. It's very bugged and I'm super disappointed in this because I was getting pretty far but the ads are every other minute or so and it's not worth the playtime I've already put into it."", ""I love the game, it's fun and addicting. But I have a problem. The Kun Fu mini game isn't functioning properly for me. Come the end of the session when its spinning for my prize since I've played it wont work. It spins but lands on one prize over and over and over again, nothing else. Since I've had the game that's my main concern. Love the game, but would like to know if that could be fixed? Thanks."", 'Terrible! More frustrating than enjoyable. EVERYTHING has an ad after it. Complete a task, level up, each cones with an ad. If you click in the game and an ad happens to pop up at the same time it locks the game up and you have to restart. Happened to me 5 times already. So disappointing since I love Ice agen and thought this would be a good game to play with the wife. Bad choice.', ""Keeps stopping or crashing, I have installed this game five times hoping it would work and it just won't work. The game is cute but you just can not play it, it won't let you. The ads don't help they help in the game not working right, everytime a ad pops up the game stops are crashes and you have to start all over again. Thank you but no thank you. Deleted game. Fix it and I will reinstall."", 'A cute, simple game that is fun to play, with some challenge to it. A great deal of patience is required, unless you are prepared to spend a lot of real money to buy acorns in order to advance quickly. The ability to visit friend villages is nice, but it is impossible to find Scrat in most of them in time to get bonus coins. The game does tend to choke my RCA 10 Viking III tablet, making it necessary to reload the current game, and ads will pop up at the most inconvenient times during game play.', ""It's a decent time sink. Wish the screen sliding mechanics weren't so sensitive. Every time I touch the screen somewhere, I'm either clicking on a building or being prompted to expand. And trying to slide a building or a decoration is also problematic as the object doesn't move, but the screen does. Progress is at a decent rate. Some areas it could be improved, but overall, it's ok."", ""Love it! A nice laid back game that you don't need to play 24/7. The only draw back is the constant ads....and if you accidentally click on one (as they appear unexpectedly) then my screen is covered with writing and nothing works. So I have to shut down the game and restart it....I sometimes need to do this twice in 5 mins. Other than this the game is perfect....by far my favourite."", ""The games itself is good I had it years ago and did really well but deleted it due to the fact it kept freezing and kicking me out and I don't just mean now and then it was almost every time I went into the app. Got it again the other day thinking it will have been sorted but the problem is still there. I progressed on the game and as I was getting more land the game kicked me out. Went back in and the land wasn't there. So frustrating so will be deleting this app. Pity because I do love it."", ""Great game, great quality, I like the way that each character is different and there is so many different things to buy, only problem I have is when you want to expand it's way to expensive and even if you get all the areas it is still to small please make the area a lot larger to add more stuff."", ""Great game, if you like the movie then you should love this. Haven't stopped playing for about 4hours. Great character drawing as well. Having a good time but a bit of a problem to change to another cloud storage to Save more characters but couldn't do and. Lost a lot of levels."", ""The rewards are pathetic. I spent 200,000 coins to complete and objective only to get 18,000 coins as a reward. Kung Fu scrat only gives one reward, regardless of the score, which is pathetic. Also I can't visit friends to collect rewards from their villages. Besides, most store items cost acorns, which are very hard to earn. This is a pay to play game that I'm not buying into because after so many years it hasn't been improved"", ""I really like the game but there are a few drawbacks. It's been more than a month since I installed it and I haven't received any news of daily/community events as the icon itself never appeared. Also, I'm unable to visit my friends as it always say connection error even though my internet connection is optimal. It's really unfair to me as a player. Please please fix this with an update ASAP!!!!!"", ""Please reinstate me to a previous level. It just went blank and when i restarted my tablet, it started over from the beginning, again. 1/29/22. Had to uninstall the game again. I don't know why I keep reinstalling it. I get to around the 8th level and it won't load . 2/23 22"", ""I love the game. It's really fun and it relieved my stress. The graphics when I zoom the characters it's excellent. I suggest that you update more items in the inventory and put some more adventures. That's it!! Very excellent ♥️"", 'I can\'t visit other people\'s sites. It always says, ""Oops."" I can\'t fully play the game. I installed FACISTBOOK, so it would work. Still NO! Plus, everything I open the game: animals and habitats vanish! Uninstalling', ""I've enjoyed playing this compare to wonder zoo. It has bigger rewards compare to the said game. The only problem i've encountered is the controls it has very sensitive controls if i click the stuff setting sometimes the expansion menu will pop up. I accidentally click the buy it with acorns. Tsk. Please kindly fix this issue."", 'Fantastic Game! Beautiful graphics, plenty of coins available which allows quick expansion and decorations, no stupid ""energy"" that runs out like in other games! Additional quirks (like little inside games and tasks) keeps it interesting. What games should be like - to play, And not to wait around untill coins mature or energy refills! 👌👍👍', 'I simply love this game. However, AS BEFORE and once again the game is frozen and black screen and slow to respond while playing. Really want to rate a 5 star. PLEASE HELP......Update, uninstalled and reinstalled working excellent only LOST my neighboring friends and unable to collect from scat. Giving this app a 4 star rating. Hopefully I can start collecting again in friends. PROBLEM FIXED 5 STARS RATING LOVE THIS GAME', 'Got an update that messed up everything, had to reinstall after saving my progress on the cloud two days ago after the reinstalling the only progress available was level 36 when i was at level 54 with 75 million coins, 30 acorns, a total of 48 land space (used real money(over 500rmb)) and 38 established friendships. Talk about wasted invested time ! I am so mad right now, email contact....automated. Basically no way of communication between game developer and player, so yeah story of my life.', ""My experience has not been real good. I have down loaded this game at least four times it has crashed on me over and over again each time when I've reached high level have accumulated a great deal of corins and have built large villages both on top and in the underworld I'm not sure if I want to reload again. How about fixing your game"", ""Crashed for the 4th time. It plays great for a while. I'm on level 78 I think. game crashes so uninstall then reinstall. Each time I reinstall, I lose a level or 2. am on WiFi 24/7 so no excuse. I'm truly disappointed as I really enjoy this game."", ""When I was little I played this game, it was SO COOL!!! But I wanted to get it again, yet there is a glitch or something. If I wanna input my age it doesn't let me, I thought it usually happens when my phone is out of space, yet there was so much space left. I did delete a few games incase, yet it didn't work... I uninstalled in and I am busy installing it again. I will change the review as soon as it does not happen again, but I know it will. Please fix this... 😣😕🤔🧐"", ""Been liking it so far. Easy to play, no need and getting resources is easy too, except silver coins, I guess. It would be nice if they're not that rare to begin with since there are some quests that can only be done by paying with them and I don't feel like spending my acorns to skip them"", ""I had rated this 5 stars but the game just set me back several levels to a previous saved spot and I lost everything I had and many hours of playing. Also it won't let me add my friends on it. When I click on friends it says there was a connection problem when I am signed in. Signing in and out doesn't help."", ""this game is absolutely cool..very relaxing...the sound effects,the village's snow everything is cool to see through our eyes.....but i dont know one thing that whenever i touch the back button in my phone,it never comes back but it shows the settings menu.i even tried to find a quit option on the menu to come back after playing the game,but i wont found it.all the times after playing this game i used to come out by clicking the home button straight away.so plz bring that option of quit in menu."", 'I love this game and everything about it except the endless ads that you never know when are going to pop and if you accidently click on them it freezes the game and you have to completely close and reboot the game. I would rather pay to own it to get rid of the ads and keep everything else as it is.', '😢😠Great but it made me update it and I lost a lot of progress I had made in a few hours. I was nearly level 8 and it sent be back to level 5. Very mad about that.', ""At first I was really enjoying this game. Its nice to create your own village. But nightmare comes when u have to change your mobile phone. You cant retrieve your game history and you'll have to start from scratch again. Which is kinda frustrating.."", ""This game would be awesome, if it wasn't for the bugs, it's says to feed the mammoth, but nothing happens! Plus I'm not getting any acorns for catching the bad guy, plus it's way to expensive too get all the things that are needed, so I'm just playing the game my own way with time and a lot of patience"", ""Game freezes quite a bit when the Amazon ad plays. Wish it didn't cost so much to build extension on the land, it goes up in price every time you buy a bit of land so having to constantly just save up to buy it makes it a bit boring."", ""It's an okay game so far. I like Ice Age for all the characters. There's alot of goals having to keep up with. Seems I'm spending coins faster than I can gain, but the goal rewards make up for the spending. I will not do any in-game purchases in any game. It's wasteful spending for my budget. So far it's an enjoyable alternate time waster! 😁"", ""This game use to be good but needs some serious attention and updating. It's glitchy as heck. the game will just out of no where freeze as I'm collecting coins or even playing the scrat mini game. There is this re a curing add that will also freeze the game and then black out the screen this happens on a regular basis. Please fix this game I love this game and I play it everyday but if this doesn't get fixed Im sorry I won't be able to play it."", ""Fantastic game. Visuals are good. But I think graphics should more improvement needs because I still playing little big city 2 in my device and it's also Gameloft's game.Graphics of this game isn't enough right from little big city 2's graphics. You also can play little big city 2. Instead of this game and if you want to enjoy a smart defined management game. Try it."", ""This game seems completely unfinished. It takes a good bit in a downloading screen before you can play and then asks permission for access to edit and delete activity on your Google play account. If you accept this it's a simple start but very laggy and the first loading screen freezes with out fail the four times I tried before delete. It's upsetting because I loved the movie as a kid and the animation isn't bad at all. The small bit of dialogue I saw was decently childish."", ""The game is fun but there are some glitches between offline and online playing. I've signed on to play continuously for 2 months just to build my coin count and receive free stuff. I have no problems signing in to continue my streak except when I go from offline playing at home and come into town and it now connects to online playing because I have signal. I have to use an acorn to continue my streak even though I've been checking in everyday, also it throws me back about 4 days which is even more frustrating. It takes twice as long to try and get said days with whatever prize. Also, the Diego coin swipe thing to claim everything with a swipe doesnt work properly. I swipe to claim and it wont claim coins even though I swipe over it multiple times. I always run out of time and still have half of my coins to claim and then get a measly bonus because the thing wont claim coins. The game is fun but these glitches are frustrating. Please do something to fix the connection between offline and online when continuing a days sign in streak."", ""One of the best games on the entire Playstore. It has a huge variaty of different animals. The money and acorn system is really fair. It is quite easy to level up, get coins and get acorns. You can play it offline so it's a great game for when you are waiting for your train etc"", ""The touch sensors are too sensitive, while scrolling through things i purchase them by an accident. Would be nice to get a confirmation popup when purchasing with nuts as I've spent way too many on things i didn't need. Otherwise it is fun to play."", 'amazing this my favorite game iv been play this game from year to year and it still the best, but theres problem of the bulding THEATER it keep says sorry no ads try again late :) and i cant get acorn just because of that problem. i keep try it several time but still says try again later, please fix this', 'This app is riddled with glitches.. constantly saying to log out and back in to social medias to fix friends list display which never works. Crashes randomly. Always has massive lag spikes. Would be such an enjoyable game if not for this.', ""I used to love this game until you stopped the fun event's. What happened to winning animals and the holiday fun? This is boring without it all. Also, you made it more expensive to buy animals and land. You can't even save up and you never get acorns.

Just WAY too easy..it basically plays itself..you just click and it auto runs you exactly where you need to go. The enemies don't even attack you unless you attack first and you can literally just run through them. It's a beautiful game though especially with the HD pack..the graphics are amazing for a phone game. Besides that it gets pretty boring because of how easy it is. It has ALOT of things that could be better...but it's also something that passes the time"", ""It's a very very good game, definitely an upgrade from the first one as far as graphics, gameplay, items, ect. But there are a few things I noticed and issues I ran into that I'd hope to see in an update as far as a part I get lost and lose my friends in the party I have no waypoint on my map showing me where they are and it sucks, another thing I'd like to see is a custom waypoint the player can place that will give us a trail to follow towards our destination overall and Wonderfull game 👍👍☺️"", 'Good game,.... but it needs to fix the user interface, at times is size is big then it goes small after a couple of seconds. This is just within the first 10 minutes of playing and u cant even see what people are writing in the chat window when it gets small if ur rendering is low ( which is in the graphics settings). Turns out the interface may be controled by the rendering, the lower the rendering the smaller the interface the higher the bigger the interface is which inclueds button sizes etc.', ""I'm enjoying it. The game world is pretty, combat is fast and fun. The only thing I can't stand is the atrocious UI, it's old looking, boring, ugly, clunky and intrusive for my taste. If that could be addressed and updated I would play more often. I have to use and see that UI often, so my gripe with that is valid and practical. Great game though."", ""I love the game, but it has connectivity problems. It won't connect via wifi at certain times of the day, morning is all good connected via wifi, afternoon & night don't even dream of it. I had it on my surface & face the same problem, had to restart it several times or just give up on it for a bit. Now on cellphone same problem. Please fix it. Thanks. Great job on the game btw!"", ""Used to be my favorite game. It took real effort to become a good player. You had to know how to use your skills, LOTS of English speaking players and once upon a time it was updated regularly. Now you've got auto everything (which is great for running to your next quest or an NPC, but ruins the game when it also auto fights for you), servers are mostly empty and the players that DO log on don't speak English and the game hasn't seen a single update in OVER TWO YEARS! Not worth playing anymore!"", ""the game is just too large. starts out as tiny, but almost every quest has you downloading hundreds of MB of data. unless you can make it playable from an SD card,I just don't see the game as being very practical. it IS fun however, I just wish it was playable on phones with less internal hard drive space."", ""I love the entire concept of the game and alot of the dynamics of it as well.but there isnt enough tutorial information!let alone information in general.. I would love to know where I'm going when I'm trying to track a quest but cant seem to find said places on the map even..I would really REALLY love to see some sort of permanant trail to follow that I could toggle off/on if needs be...considering the arrow on the mini map has been pointing the same direction since I've made my characters.."", 'Excellent game development. Best game i ever played. Pros: NON auto or at the very least semi auto so when u dont know where to go then u have the option to hit the quest and it show u where to go which is good. Nice, smooth gameplay and graphics. DMs respond as well! They have helped me quickly with stuff i lost a few times! Cons: Crashes are few but do exist though. HATE the Bullying and trash talk. Hope someone does something about that.', ""The auto-pathing in this game is horrendous. Click your quest and it just runs far in a different direction like it can't find a path so it just runs away which makes auto almost useless. The cosmetics don't even fit the characters. I looked at the lucky cross shop, the glasses are on my forehead, the bunny ears are floating in the air a foot higher than my head. Literally almost everything in the game is flawed. Even the basic functions."", 'The gameplay was fun, But I would have liked to see a more indication of direction. The game had some serious glitches at the beginning with it just shutting down.The controls are pretty good. Didnt like how the fighting seem to act almost action turn base.Umm, its over its interesting, I like how it tried its best to go console style.Lots of issues with turning and maintaining direction.', ""OC2 is the best MMO on the play store, hands down... a real achievement in mobile gaming and almost PC-quality when it comes to delivering a typical MMO experience. It's a shame though that the game has been abandoned and no further content is coming, and I deducted points for it. Didn't play the first one, for the record. Recommended for MMO fans needing a fix on mobile and anyone looking for some vagueish WoW nostalgia."", ""It seems like a fun game in the theme park MMO genre, but then you get spammed with the pay 2 win and loot boxes. Give me the same game without the Store. Update: Gave it another try. I think this may be the best MMO on the Store, but it's still kind of lackluster. Too many pay2win pop-ups ruin an otherwise good experience. This game is a case study in how not to do freemium."", 'Holy rubberbanding, Batman. I thought my character was going to get whiplash. That and constantly running in random directions AWAY from the quest target, while using the autorun feature. Never mind the large file size that the graphics do NOT justify. Others pull off better with less. The only thing more over inflated than the file size seems to be their egos over how good they think this game is.', 'I have both of my characters stuck in Coramir... I tried to avoid going there but I really wanted to do the christmas event. Everytime I try to log in on both characters it sits there saying ""reloading"" for about 5 minutes then the game restarts completely...I have a decent gaming phone an LG G6, I have the graphics low and tried a game booster app, I\'ve reinstalled the app multiple times and restarted my phone mutiple times. Still having this problem.', ""Originally a three, however I had to lower the score. This game is simply broken. The auto run system sometimes makes me run around in circles or back and forth, so I just ignore it and make my own way there. The game spawned me in a flower where I couldn't move or attack anything, ended up dying which was actually helpful. I got killed by something that didn't show on my screen till I was dead. Npc's don't appear unless I reload. Crashes alot. I spent £0.99 on this game and I feel ripped off."", ""right.ive had to change my review now! will you please sort out these freezing bugs!!! for Christ sake ,doing the solo twice a day but when the game Fu**ing freezes I don't get any rewards and I loose one turn. You are waisting my chances at getting a legendary weapon and to upgrade my fusion weapon because you won't sort out your bugs. the amount of times this game freezes at the most un-opportune times is ridiculous. SORT YOU DAMN game out. surely I can't be the only person it happens too."", ""After some several minutes of playing, the game is crashing. Every time I must to close - open the game and it's very annoying. Until you fix this problem I would not change the rating. The game/gameplaying is great, But with this bugs it makes him very unpleasant to play. Fix the bugs and then I am sure that every player will be happy."", ""When I used to play this game there was no auto run and I was level 25 but I tried it again and there is no exploration at all. I have lost 6 quests from traveling to another area and from fast traveling to another area. I do not know why all games are just auto run now a days. Hey let's just push a button to beat the game!! Drives me insane!"", ""This game sure is good but there's just too many of those p2w items in the store for an outdated game with unmaintained server. I like the first O&C better but I don't dislike this one in fact I like its quests better than the first one, also the pc version servers is dead I was looking to play it on pc 'cause the ping in mobile version goes up to 900ms. Hope you'd just make another O&C MMO or sell this one to another company who can actually keep the game running and active."", ""Beautiful amazing game with such a nice decent graphics and music. Well I am little bit disappointed from the developers there is no story mode you will get a numerous list of missions and objectives which you have to complete. Totally confusing with skills and upgrading method no tutorial either. Maps and navigation in the game totally weird. You can't locate your objectives with your own, you have to take automode help to reach there. Which is loosing interest in many mmorpg games now days."", 'The game itself is fun, but pretty buggy. In fact, I made a purchase of a seasonal item for $49.99. The item never arrived. I filed a support ticket and didn\'t get an initial response until almost four days. By the time support replied, the event had ended and they were unable to send the item. I\'ve now been ""waiting on the developers"" for 5-6 days now. I made an offer to make it right, but support is not responding. The game is 3/5, support is 1/5.', ""I cannot understand why you leave this project in the middle of providing as it is the best game i've ever played with the best graphics i've ever seen (i watch other games of yours but those ones are not good and ideal as this one). Hope you'll come back soon and reprovide this game again, as i'm waiting for it i'll not delete it from my phone, hah"", 'Excellent graphics, fun mmorpg... too bad they stopped updating it 2 years ago. Seems like its worth playing through to max level but not much longer after that due to lack of community. Feels just like a casual single player adventure game; wont be spending a dime on it unless they sell to Blizzard or something (which by the way would be a great idea...)', ""After a day or two of the internet connection error, the error resolved itself. Hopefully it won't occur again. Aside from that the game itself is amazing, it has a strong nostalgic feel to it reminding me of the top tier MMOs from the era of world of warcraft."", ""Game is fun and all but now it won't let me login. Says connected 100% but won't go past the loading screen. It even acts like it logs into one of my characters and shows the moving icon but still won't go past the connecting screen"", ""Game - Good Graphics - Good Storyline - Average Controls - Average Character (speed) - Very slow compared to anytype of Games *Connection Issue - I've connected to WiFi, but it doesn't detect any network to download the game, yet game was running fine. *Bug - (auto) I passed through the boat while swimming and went under the wooden harbor, and coming near to destination and suddenly I popped up above ground. ***Suggestion - Monsters should attack the user when they are near (it'll be exciting)"", 'i really like the game, the graphics is awesome and the soundtrack is very good but the ""guide arrow"" is a bit broken, when i go for a quest the guide arrow doesn\'t show the way that i suppose to go, even though i dont have any quest the ""guide arrow"" still showed. Plz fix the ""guide arrow"", it really annoying, i know..... that this game have auto run but i really like to control my character.(sorry my english is not that good but i hope you can understand what i\'m saying)✌✌✌', ""First this was so Amazing the story cutscene in the beginning was like from a movie. But then the lag Comes in and Ruins it. The Lag here is a very big problem not like in the first game. The downloading sucks so bad why don't just Put all the files in the playstore in the first place? Anyway the new UI looks cool but IT HAS A TON OF MONITIZATION IN IT. Decrease it and the new Inventory looks decent but I prefer the old one. I hope you make Order and chaos 3."", ""This is actually the Best RPG I've ever Played, It has a story that I'll never forget, I made so much progress and I made this a part of my daily routine, I can't thank you enough devs. The graphics is just so good I can't stop taking Screenshots, This game is clearly the Closest RPG you'll ever Find to a Open world Real time Android playable game. Although it needs Ai upgrades and a few more characters and colors for characters I myself prefer a more vocal update. Anyhow I love it 5 star ✓"", ""Decently fun, open world, but could really use some work. The enemies have no agro, the world feels very small, there's several different types of currency (most of which is item or vendor specific, that you have to pay real money to get). I came to this game because someone said its like wow, but this game is very different. It's nice, but not what I'm looking for"", ""Please update the app, we want to be able to still play in 2021 and beyond. Also please fix random world map pop-up when using controllers. UPDATE: To log in with Google account, remove this game from accessing your account in Google account settings - force stop game - clear cache. Downloaded all data even HD, but upon switching to quality mode game won't log in, stuck at connecting screen. Fix this game!"", ""Loved the first one, wanted to try OaC2. It says I failed to connect regardless of being on WiFi or 3G/4G. Gets to 60% and just fails over and over. I've tried restarting my phone, reinstalling, no fix. I could download the extra files with no issue, but I just cannot connect to the game server."", ""Great game needs some work with gameplay options. But overall great game.First you should add some kind of healer type character like on the first order an chaos then Yall should change the dungion ques to unlimited and ques for tanks healers and dps .....then the game would be about perfect....and the chat setup on the first game was setup a little better but that's just my opinion. Thanks have a good one."", ""Bvllshit! I was playing the game just fine until I got to a point where I need to kill a boss to complete a quest. there are several high levels commiting abuse and continually killing it so I can't do the quest! and is gameloft doing anything to help? nope! Other players ruined the game and I'm sure this is not the only instance. Go play world of prandis, its 100% better in every way, and it is up and coming and nicely maintained, trust me you'll love it and forget gamelofts games."", ""Yeah I'm just going to say it it's world of Warcraft mobile, don't get me wrong though it's good picking your own character and class and all it's just the side quests aren't rewarding at all with very little XP and on top of that you don't see any change like, hey help me take care of my farm and you do but the field is still full of serpents or whatever still though definitely worth playing it's just they should make the side quests more rewarding for it to be a really good RPG game."", ""The camera zooms out automatically, there's an extra 900 and 100 mb file download and the HD files don't do much to help. There are little rewards and inorder to become stronger,you have no choice but to pay money, like a lot of money. A good fusion costs about 1000gold and from level one to level 6, I haven't been able to get more than 700 gold. Perhaps it was good before but now, it's obvious that this game serves no purpose than to make money."", 'About the last 10 times I\'ve tried to play, I get stuck at the loading screen with a blinking ""Connecting...100%"". I have a 4g unlimited plan on my phone. My phone model is not available on their list so I\'m unable to file a request that way. Tried customer service 3 or 4 times and about to uninstall this game.', ""This game is indeed one of best mmo, the gameplay and immersive environment still better than current mmorpg game that lack of those things. However, the sad things is the game always force close on challenge rush and dungeon, and stamp/entrance ticket, rewards are gone forever... It seems like the ios and windows version doesn't have this bug, and fps very high even on old device, whats wrong with android version? If u can still play on windows with same server as android, it will be best."", ""The 1st one was better.

Yes it's a little difficult to get started but once you play, it becomes very simple and addicting. I'm looking through the review section and I'm hearing a lot of Complaining and crying just because they keep getting attacked when they forget this is A-war game. If you understand how to use ports and Shields you have no problem surviving on a server, no matter how many level 30s there are. keep it up!"", ""Terrible Customer Service. I've been playing for almost 10 months. I've never had a problem until a couple days ago. I set a 24 hr shield that quit on me in 8 hours resulting in an attack. I then set another 24 hour shield that quit on me just the same. The 3rd one finally worked. I contacted customer care and they were argumentative and unwilling to help. The game is fun to play, but if you need customer care, good luck. All I wanted was to be restored. Terrible Customer Service"", 'Would rate much higher. However, graphics and layout are below par compared to its competitors. Any improvement would greatly benefit this app. Strangley enough, the graphics of the real time battles are good while the rest of the game in which players spend more time looking at is less than it should be and has me looking for other similar apps.', ""WPO has more or less become my game of choice. While you don't really need money to play, it certainly does help. Some of the game instructions could be a litte more detailed or clearer, but you get the gist of how things work after a while. It's a very engaging game that offers in-group and out- group chat. Having patience helps; base development can ( and sometimes should) be slow. Overall, I recommend this game."", ""Standard graphics, kinda creative base building. My issue is with farming. Takes 3 to 4 hrs with boost. And u need a VIP to even search for tiles! Also, the packs are way to expensive. I promise you, if u buy a $20, you wont see them for $20 again. This game want $50 to $100 from you consistently. And it's just not that great of a game to demand that level of packs with no other options of lower priced packs."", ""Been waiting on my commander getting fixed for 6 months.

But I have one request Gameloft, and I wish you see it, even if you won't: Please make this game not pay-to-win, rather, make it play-to-win. Everywhere I go, there is money, money and money. Symbols of real life currency everywhere. What about young people who don't have money? They come home after studying whole day to play this, but then it asks you for money to win. Please Gameloft, it's my only wish. And the only reason one star is not there."", 'The goal posts are continually while updates increase gap between players. the game play is totally unrealistic with a single commander doing more damage than the entire army under command, plain ridiculous.', ""game is good, but expensive.

UPDATE, GAMELOFT NEVER REIMBURSED ME FOR WHAT I PAID FOR AND LOST AS A RESULT OF THEIR SERVER CRASHING AND ME BEING LOCKED OUT OF MY ACCOUNT 40 DAYS. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. COMPANY NEEDS TO BE SUED.', ""It's a great game but the renegade events are a little to hard now. Before I could 3 hit a level 4 hideout and now with plus 2 million power I can barely make a dent, pls fix.(btw I'm the one with plus 2m power.) For some reason I can't get on the game now( I'm on phone) and it keeps kicking me off. Please fix"", 'The game is good with a level of complexity to maintain interest. The game support people are helpful. Just one thing needs improving. One faction should not be allowed to control all of the provinces with specific boosts. For example, army size. This would help create greater balance between factions and prevent a world being dominated by one faction or individual and make the game fun once again.', ""Such a nice game/application!

The player with more money always wins. ALWAYS. If you don't want to pay money, you'll lose every battle against players who do pay. If you do pay, you'll be feeding thousands to gameloft each month if you're not careful."", ""One of the whorst game I ever play, you have to pay for everything, costumer care , don't care about players , just $$$, If you are not rich, don't play , waist of time, better try find better game"", 'I like the game.

I love the world map mechanism, design and detail. The upgradingof buildings is not too long, and the free speed up consumable is great, instead of having to use currency that requires real money. Overall, a great and addictive game that I will keep on play. Thanks Gameloft,! Keep up the good work.', 'Downloaded and didn\'t even open it. I downloaded this game JUST to give it a 1 star review because one of the games Ads quote ""I\'ve been to Afghanistan"" ""this game is so real"" How incredibly disrespectful and just flat out stupid thing to say about the people who actually fought over there.', ""The game is pretty nice but few things need to be fixed.. The two most annoying things to fix as soon as possible are: - The scrolling down in messages page, elite deposits page, members page and all the other pages, because it brings you on top page while you scroll down; - The private messages most of the times are not sent and you cannot communicate to a player and same thing is for faction messages, plus it gets stuck and doesn't receive messages anymore until you notice it and close and reload the game. If those issues will be fixed, I'll put 5 stars."", ""It is good game, i love it. But Sometimes can't log in it always led to reconnection, even when there is no network problem. And upgradation of higher level take too much time, with huge resources demand and that is too hard to get. And One more, in app purchase is too high a price just for measly virtual materials. Plz make some changes."", ""Can't finish tutorial cus the tutorial button doesn't even line up with tutorial guide that tells u what u need to do"", 'Fun, but unable to teleport to a new world is frustrating', ""It's got alot of the trimmings of a Great game suburb design barely if any bugs and pretty graphics but it's also got a lot of the short comings many games with similar mechanics have. Stamina mechanics and long build times to mention 2 it does try to compensate with a lot of speed ups but it just feels like a clone and I've said this before gameloft is a power house in the mobile gaming community they should be leading the pack but titles like this just don't do them justice"", 'The game is really good. You need add more weapon like person fighter jets.', 'Very interesting game with good graphic design.', ""FALSE ADVERTISEMENT AND MISLEADING. Just saw a few of their adds and they are NOTHING like the real gameplay. Tried this game in 2019 and installed again....no new changes. A few visual upgrades, but you don't control any units.

Sure it is fun and has fun modes, but you never get to play since you have to relog every time you switch screens. Or you just get dropped at some point and it crashes. It is also very pay to play. The rate of dropping any good characters is ridiculously low, so spend spend spend or you are stuck with the basics. And they let you know too with the ""deals"" they push on every single screen which pop up in the common click areas to ensure accidental clicks.', ""Unplayable, keeps asking me to download files over Wi-Fi (which I'm connected to) and I keep getting a download error saying to try again when I have an internet connection. I obviously have a connection or wouldn't be able to post this review. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times over the past 2 weeks."", ""This is a very special game. You'll really love it your first week. However, when the progression slows, so will your interest. The repetitive grind is unavoidable no matter how much money you spend. I would recommend anyone to get started but don't invest too much because the grind will make it unplayable very soon. Edit: I have experience with Gameloft losing my entire account and having to spend all over again. Maybe it's something they do."", 'Games that have virtual joysticks should also support bluetooth controllers. I want to like this game. However, without bluetooth controller support I cannot enjoy this game. If you want to be successful then consider this. Not everyone can play using touch screen buttons.', '***EDIT This is the most unstable game I have ever played. I have played it on my phone and PC, and it randomly crashes several, 3-5 times a day, on both. Also, while my internet connection is great, 50mbs+, the game is still laggy af. This might be something that is simple to resolve, however that is impossible too know as there is literally 0 customer support. Could have been a great game, but instead it sucks.', 'Played the game for about two weeks. Then out of nowhere the game gets stuck on intial loading screen. If I get lucky I can make it to the game. This is where this game took a dump. Join guild quest for progression is broken, and all actions beside walking around in hub are broken. The visuals in the game are astounding, but the network\\connection issues are ridiculous, did not expect that from Gameloft.', ""Very good game, super addictive. Though make sure you do a bit of research before you get too far in, it's very easy to accidentally waste valuable resources in game. The only critique I have is that the push notifications are terrible. They pop up at random times and say things that are either like 14 hours out of date or just not true. Other than that it's a very fun game"", ""This game is beautiful. Very similar to summoners war if you like games like that. I think this game has a ton of potential to be VERY strong and competitive in this space. There are a few things holding it back. One is the instability of 5v5 and lag of the game in general. 5v5 is a great, super fun mode but often crashes or doesnt load in at all. The leading screens get stuck or take a very long time sometimes. Next is the event system. There needs to be more events that overlap each other to keep players engaged, and they need a consistent event currency so players can purchase items fro the event shoul after the event has been completed (or at least for a week following, ending it the same day as the event is not good). The last thing, which I'm sure will come with time is just growth. Needs a larger player base and more monster selection. The aesthetic upgrades upon awakening could use a little work as well (more difference in look once upgraded). That being said it's a great game which I have spent money on and look forward to seeing grow in the future. Beautiful aesthetics, fun modes, good and balanced rewards."", ""I've been playing the game for months now. Got to max level and have seen the game progress. I love the game but I've gotten to a point where the ads are getting on my nerves.. I've almost bought the 99€ pack without even wanting because they throw them all over the place and you end up clicking it even by accident. Please Gameloft remove these spamming ads and make the connection more stable, i sometimes have to close all apps and restart cause i moved just a little outside of wifi area getting into 4G."", ""the gameplay is really great and stuff. but when it comes to trying to get the champions that are available for a certain period of time through the summoning that's just impossible. I spent a lot of time trying to get just one of the champions I never got one up to 6 to 7 times I've tried. could you least give increase chances because the chances in this game extremely low. I get better chances in other games I can get a special within my second role. you say it's a crease chances but it's not"", ""The game itself is quite well thought out and fun. My biggest issue with this game is the absolute hyper sexualization of female characters. It's disgusting and pathetic. The art for the new event is uncalled for and again, shameful. I'm not a prude, it's just THAT bad. To add to this the amount of bugs in this game are INSANE. Disconnections, dungeons failing even though you beat them, beating a dungeon yet having all the buttons disappear so you have no option but to force quit, chat crashing your game, pvp crashing your game, etc. I've got screen shots. If this game is ever 95% free of major bugs as it should be considering people pay for in game packs, then yes, fun to play and great game design. Until then, don't even bother and don't expect to get any crystals back from wasted energy due to crashes. So many people experiencing bugs and crashes you aren't going to be hearing back any time soon."", 'A great combination of different kinds of game experiences. Sounds and graphics are amazing. But it has serious connection issue. That causes a ""long waiting"" situation at the end of the fights which forces you to leave up the session. It may hurt a bit if you won an arena fight..', 'The connection is very bad, I can run other games smoothly but this game keeps showing ""connection to the server timed out"". Very disappointed, I can\'t even collect my daily rewards, it keeps loading then exits the game automatically without collecting the reward. Very disappointed. How am I supposed to trust the game? I wanted purchase some items with real money but the it has a connection problem, so I hesitate to buy it.', 'Game freezes. I played for 2 days, it was fine, i was ready to grind. But one day suddenly I cant start the game, it freezes on the loading page. It kept like this for a few days when I try to open the game..I was hoping for an update maybe it would fix. I havent deleted the game yet.', 'there are two mature problems here. first is that there is no ""skip tutorial"" button. The biggest problem is that in the tutorial where it\'s says ""ADENTURE is the best place to make your champions stronger"" when i click on the highlighted ""ADVENTURE"" button, and than on the , highlighted ""2"" on the map the ""battle"" button doesn\'t respond to my touch. Since i am still in the tutorial i also can not use any other button. that makes the game unplayable. i was really excited about this game. :(', ""Love the game, but 3 stars because 1. It advertises you packages everytime you reopen the game on mobile, and 2. bigger reason, because you constantly have to turn on auto mode when it should remember from last time you played. Many times I start a sequence and my players are just standing there.... If I've clicked auto 100 times, should it not stay that way until the user changes it? Hmmm"", 'Constant pop-over ads. Order buttons placed where ""OK"" button is for dialogue that it replaced. 0.02% drop rates so most events give nothing of value even with high time investment. Events that can only be completed by spending cash and best gear locked behind either awful drop rates and random stats or a direct purchase. Very common no connection errors only for this game. Watching ads commonly fails to deliver reward.', ""I really like the game, and I would rate 5 stars. Although, everytime it says the open the collection book, it always crashes my game. I open the character menu and it won't let me do anything unless I press it, and then the game crashes. Please fix this and I will rate 5 stars"", 'After months of playing the game, my account was reset to the beginning. This is the worst bug I have seen so far. There are many other bugs present and the developers use their users (us) to identify them. There have also been several fiascoes since launch. For a detailed explanation on the bugs and malpractices, please check their reddit page (too many to list).', 'I like the game and concept. unfortunately I experience a lot of game instability. I get kicked out regularly. I have laggs due to loading issues (even if my connection is up and running). handling of the menu feels very slow and the chat system can be improved.', ""This is a good example of a pay to win game. It's filled with so many useless characters you could find one character with 6+ separate versions of itself but no difference in stat. 5v5 takes years to pair. 3*-5* summons with a 90.1% chance of getting 3* character really???. Learn from mobile legends if you want to move forward with this game. And also stop reminding of your useless offers each time i click a new section. I'll uninstall this game soon. Thank you."", ""The game is buggy as hell. From the 5vs5 systems which takes a hell of a long time to load ( if you are lucky and don't get stuck at the loading screen) to just random loadings which never recover. You have to reload the game 10 times. Everyone uses bot and it gets unpunished."", ""Absolute garbage... What happened to you Gameloft? You used to make such great games, like The Dark Knight Rises, The Amazing Spider-Man 1 & 2, Gangstar Rio, Dungeon Hunter 4... And now this? I don't get it, it's like everygame you release is just worse then the previous. Poor gameplay, simplefied graphics, no depth to the campaing at all and the WORST thing... 250+ champions, but all of them are too simple and uninteresting. Sorry, but I really can't give you more than 1 star."", ""It's like summoners war and league of legends had a baby. It's really fun! One thing I think can be improved on is the enemy focusing system. I find it hard to click on an enemy. But, other then that, the game is amazing!!"", ""The game's a fun idea but it's pretty unstable freezes or rashes completely at least once a day usually more. I was enticed in by Twitch prime but on downloading the game could not redeem the twitch stuff (invalid code). Gameloft's support have so far (4 tickets in) been unable to understand what a twitch prime code is much less help with my issue so I'm not filled with confidence that it'll be resolved. 3 stars because I do actually like the game but I doubt that I'll play it again"", 'This game is too complicated for me. There are so many options that I am unsure what to do. This is not fun. Also, the free items videos do not play successfully on my device. Usually the game hangs and the only option is to reboot the device if I want to continue playing the game. I have decided to pass on this game and uninstall it. I gave the game a second try and it turned out to be a waste of time. it takes too long to get enough gold to upgrade the armor, or get disks.', ""First off, this game is amazing. It is a lot of fun to manage your characters, and play with them in various modes. There is always something to do. The art style is pretty awesome, and the sound design is top notch. What ruins the whole thing is not that it is a free to play game. You really can get by without paying anything. This isn't a tenable goal for a publisher, but on the surface this game pulls it off well. It's only after playing for a couple days that you realize that many of the practices employed in the monetization of this game are predatory. They use deceptive language to entice you to gamble away your hard earned currency, but still hide your odds in plain sight. Player beware."", ""After update the game continuously crashes. I originally had it rated at 4/5 and that was due to connection errors and server issues that occurred occasionally. After the updated it crashes nonstop and it's so bad that completing daily quests is a chore, which is unfortunate. 2/5"", ""Installed the game. Downloaded a large packet for the games files. Completed the tutorial map. Was told to go to the first world to level up my new champion. Game interface wouldn't respond to my touch. Closed the game and relaunched. Was forced to do the tutorial again. Uninstalled."", ""To be honest, I love the game . lots of content, 5v5 mode,everything its here. lots of heroes,and much more . I will give it 5 stars ,but two things I am not happy with. The game it's loading to much and collapses a bit to much lately. Please fix it if possible :)"", ""It's one of the better p2w games I've played, as always prices are crackhead greedy. What I like about it most is the various multiplayer battle systems that is random, it really levels out the ability for groups to severely dominate in all aspects. Some of us do have lives. Biggest perk is it's not extremely over ran with Chinese people getting half price or less. So many reasons to not even bother playing phone apps any more, mostly the sheer greed. Game consoles do fine on a $35 sale single sale... These phone games want tens of thousands a head to max things, that's crackhead greedy!!!"", 'fantastic game in theory poorly managed by the company. it has so much potential but the many bugs and constant crashing make the game unplayable. On top of that they use shady tactics to trick you into buying packs that go up to 300€. stay clear from this game and company. save yourself the time and phone space and download something else', ""I really loved this game.. played in the testing, and so on.. Uninstalled, and just decided to come back and my account is completely gone. of gave me no chance to log into anything, forced me into the tutorial, then when attempting to find a way to link an account or something is seems to not have recognized a previous account... really bums me out. as I had alot of gems and characters.. guess I'll just not play again..."", 'At the beginning this game looks pretty cool and enjoyable, but after 2 days of playing i feel that i just waste my time and struggling to make a progress. The game is too repetitive and very slow. Every thing is expensive. Not recommended, save your time and money.', 'Not a moba person but Summoners War was a favourite of mine. I dig the team building and the experience of building a team in this title is fast and to the point. The loot system is satisfying enough to keep me coming back on a daily basis. I dont know what else to say. Cheers!', 'Good combat, graphics are nice for mobile, but game is not optimized very well. Finishing a mission it asks me to connect to internet, when I am connected. Tried on wifi and data. Can use browser or internet use apps while playing, but insists I a not not connected. Would be a great game if it would let me play. Using android j7 plus.', ""First off, this game crashes and booted me out a lot. That aside, overal it's a pretty boring grind fest, with a boring character roster. Don't be fooled. Nearly all these characters are the same with a mere three elemental variants. I played for several hours and was still stuck using the same two characters they gave me as part of the story. I couldn't be bothered to keep grinding in the hopes of finding a character that fit my tastes."", ""Attempts to trick you into buying in-app purchases accidently. This game has a horrible habit of shoving its promotions on your screen when you go to click something so that the confirm Google purchase screen pops up right away. I have almost accidently bought a $100 package a few times because of this. Until this sketchy gimmick is removed I can not bring myself to say it's a 5star game."", ""Very good game and can become very addictive. If you have a competitive nature I suggest you shouldn't play this game unless real money is not a issue for you. Just when you think your strong everything is going well, your leveling up you will hit a road block. Where it take real money to go further and grow stronger to compete with other players; You can also wait months as a free player to get the proper item or summoning to compete. Another good game ruined by money and not by skills."", 'As with most free games the monetization model is overly greedy. Random chance for what you want $20 to $100. Considering no physical production costs all loot box type stuff should be 50c to $1 at most. 100 people spending $5 would be better than one able to afford $100.

Spent tons of money on it too. Well I guess the developers removed it from PC. So now I tried playing it on my android and it force closes. Really? You have such a fantastic game here please fix this, especially after it being removed the PC platform. I would think this wouldn't be an issue and that you would try to make this a workable game on cellular devices. Also why can't I have platinum blonde hair for my character?"", 'Awesome game. Closest thing to a classic mmorpg on app store. Needs a reboot server with some faster experience to draw some players back in. Maybe a few new classes as well. This game is still amazing I remember buying it back in the day thinking it was revolutionary. Pretty much one of the only mmorpgs that does not play itself. Wish the game was still striving and the leveling was a bit faster.', 'This is by far one of the best MMORPG out there, but it seems to have massively lost its way. The server connection issues are constant and the community seems to have become almost nonexistent. Character customization, graphics, game play, open world exploration... All of it is great! Just lacks a lot of what I remember from its origin. Fix the server connection issues and send me a message and I will return.', 'Its actually a really good World of War craft type game. The auto rotation is completely backwards though. As soon as the game launches, it auto-rotates to the left with the ""home"" button right near the attack controls and won\'t flip the other way no matter how many times I rotate and flip the phone. Incredibly annoying when the game keeps closing', ""I love the game. Has good graphics. Easy to play. Best thing is no auto play. You actually have to play the game. I started playing about a month ago. Everything was fine, no issues. I had a low lvl 28 character that is just deleted. Upon making a new character, every time i try to log in and play i get disconnected or told my username or password does not exist. I've tried all the troubleshooting methods. Nothing works. Very dissatisfied with the issue. Fix these issues. Would give less than 1."", ""Excellent game, it has everything to keep you busy for quite sometime. I haven't been able to play for awhile and I come back to an even better game than when I left it. Great upgrade, graphics, battles and so many other great things to do. Install it and you wont be disappointed! 2021 Update; I love this game and still playing for awhile without any problems. Nov. 2021, my facebook account is now no longer available and I've lost a great character and everything that I've gained.Disappointed!!!"", 'Everything you read about this game in the reviews is true. This is an amazing game. The graphics, the gameplay, the classes, the quests, its all true and its really awesome. But there are some other things that are also true. The server sync issues are caused by cheaters duplicating items and interrupting the gameplay and progress of others. Gameloft refuses to fix the issue but instead they ban innocent players like me for collecting free lotto gems during the sync. The button said ""Free Now""!', ""Game is ruined. Don't play it. Really loved this game. Lots like WOW. But lately, it disconnects when trying to log in, after a few minutes of playing or most frustrating, after you play it gives error synching server, logs you off and you lose all game progress playing. Very frustrated 😡. Tell me when it's fixed"", ""Was unexpectedly hit by a wave of nostalgia and decided to return to this game after a couple of years but its worse than before. Disconnections and roll backs every 5 min. As well as connection timeouts. This game has been completely abandoned and gameloft has let it turn into garbage. This was once my favorite game of all time. Now I'm stuck at lvl 6 with this new character because i cant even stay online. Server seems dead also. Truly a shame."", ""A fantastic game....if it plays right. It's been around a while n personally I feel it still has the greatest potential of any mobile rpg. Unfortunately the problem is that there is a significant lag component during battles,making for a very awkward fight. My characters attk comes a full 3 seconds after I tap the button.its very frustrating to tap the attk button thn have to wait tht long.the game could b so great if they would fix the small things."", 'excellent game especially if you like world of Warcraft. If the dungeon finder worked properly it would be better. The last two weeks it has put me in the same dungeon every time I select random. Also it takes at least an hour to find other people for a dungeon. If these problems were solved the game would be excellent. please fix the dungeon finder and make more quests for each level.', 'Unfortunately the game is unable to be played. There are people who sync the servers and duplicate items and while there doing so it either kicks you out of the game or you will sit there and connect to the game again which can take anywhere between 6min and 15min. This happens regularly and when it does happens can take up to 8 hours for them to stop and make the game playable again.', ""I've been playing for a long time, have payed for extra character slots and have maxed out every class in the game. Absolutely Love the game. Have spent years dedicated to it. 2017 one of my characters randomly got deleted I tried to contact the developers about it but nothing. Dedicated to the game I made a new one and over the span of a few months maxed him out. Then again in 2018 3 of my characters went poof! But I kept playing. 2019 I just cant... Account deleted and I cant play due to bugs"", 'Could use an overhaul to the UI and camera. Sad that Gameloft dropped this game (and looks like they dropped 2 as well) I enjoyed this game wayyyyy back when it first came out and was like $6.99 and I swear this was one of the VERY few mobile games that ever got me away from my console. I have spent so much money on in-game stuff throughout the years on my iPhone and I would continue doing so on my Android device IF the game were still supported well. Smoother camera plz.', ""I love this game, it's really fun. Fun! It's really enjoyable and it's the one MMORBG I've been looking for. Or I can play an undead character. And you really can't find that in a lot of games! But I did find a bug where I go to equip something or use an item and it won't let me. Plus when I go to my equipment it kicks me out of the game, I hope it's a bug that can be dealt with but out of all it is a fun game"", ""Like most other ppl who have reviewed this. You can't equip anything and if you go to your char profile it crashes the game. Could be fun for a bit of old school mmorpg very reminiscent of WoW however the equip bugs and not being able to close windows either stops this from being playable."", ""I want to love this game but I can't.... issue is I can't equip items or use any items in my bags. If I try the game crashes instantly. Other than that game plays well and feels like a mobile world of warcraft. If I could only equip and use the items I've picked up I would love it."", 'Controls are badly unresponsive. Clicking to close menu pop ups has no effect. Target selection often fails. Does not respond to ""equip"" button for gear. Crashed within first 5 minutes of play. Fails minimum functionality test.', ""You might have a lot more players if people could actually sign up to play without it glitching 100 times and taking an hour just to start playing. This is especially true since I've never played and am just looking for a fun game. If a sime sign-up is this glitchy, I can't imagine the torture for the players in the game! Wow."", ""Very empty server's, but it's not bad game. I don't know how it's going to be for dungeon team or party apart from that I will play to see the outcome at later levels."", 'Game abandoned, a legit wild west in here... Many bugs, most famous one is duplicating level 5 gems... You won\'t be ban unless you keep the cash flowing... A legit blackmail by the company!!! You\'ll see newbies standing in greenmont with level 5 gems and max out gear from one hit bug with zero skill level talking trash and flexing their ""Oh please I\'m legit, I got all these from honest gameplay"" egos brought to you and part by GameloftSE retards!!! I\'ll give it no star if I\'m able to...', 'Seems fun but unplayable when disconnecting every 5 minutes or certain inventory bugs crash game . Needs better optimization for Android', ""Id never gotten my halo back on my main account, can I have it back? This is ridiculous its. Been almost 3 years+, other than that the game is good, you guys need to give the small guys royal 7-9 more options to buy things. Even if they're not as valuable as the 10-15. Also who can I talk to the have my little brothers account unbanned? The account was banned during the syncing but never duped annything... so??? Hundreds of dollars gone to waste until 2050"", ""Practically unplayable. I can't use items from inventory, this includes equipment and packages. The buttons just don't work. Also, I played this on PC a few years ago and my account just got wiped, on login there were no characters any more."", ""I honestly can't say much about its gameplay, since I couldnt log in. After linking my google account and creating a character (with much difficulty as it started disconnecting every moment and I had to login again with google) when I started gameplay I could only play for a few minutes before I'd get the notification that my username doesnt exist and kick me out. Took all the fun out of the mega awesome graphics. I have to say with a sequel out the game is pretty much neglected now in 2019."", ""Idk why people r saying that there is a problem with equipping stuff cuz I found no problem in it at all and also some people said that lvling up is slow even tho the lvling up in this game is perfect. Not too slow or fast. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the mounts. It would be nice if getting mounts was easier then how they set it up cuz its hard to get one like this."", ""I have a new Galaxy A42 5G phone , why can't I click and use stuff in my bags ? Every time I click on my profile then gear the game force closes and I can't see my stats .. please help me figure it out"", 'Love the game. Wish there was graphic settings though to fine tune our devices. View distance ""see characters and enemies from a far"", resolution, ultra to ultra low settings, ect. Sure old engine but it still can get the upgrade no problem. Just sucks devs dropped the best mmorpg for android now. Still plays but never know the servers might close next.', 'UNPLAYABLE: Loads to login screen, but cant get any further, when i click ""Create Account"" i get a white screen that never loads anything.', ""Please fix the joystick. Just make it stationary or like in the app Soul Knight. I want to play this game but it's so painful to play with a wandering joystick....really just the worst idea ever. Worse than mouse acceleration. I'm probably going to stop playing just because of that and the navigation system."", ""Can't do anything in the game I want to equip something and nothing happens and now I can't teleport I'll give it a 5 stars when the issue gets solved"", ""I'm done. I can't play this anymore, I keep disconnecting and I don't know why. Gameloft just left this game to die and it's just sad. It's way better than the second one, and my phone doesn't even load the graphics in the second one so. Please fix it. I beg you. It's an awesome game and I hate seeing go to waste. I uninstalled it and I'm going to play World of Kings until this company decides to fix and update the game. Until then , bye bye.😟😭😟"", ""Microsoft this is the game to reinvest in. I've spent countless hours on this game. A small revamp would be an amazing help here. (I've also spent a good chunk of change here too so kinda bummed out about that) this game could be a juggernaut again if it listen to it's fan base. Gonna stay 1 star untill then."", ""Normally enjoy this game but I have a glitch where I can't teleport or loot and no way of contacting company to let them know... I reinstalled game, cleared cache restarted phone and nothing fixing it.... don't know if I'm the only one with the issue. But game worked fine the last two months..."", ""Okay I'm pretty irritated, I got my first character lvl 60 and got the boost lvl item, so I boosted my alt character and equiped the gear given but then it says synchronizing with server and when I got back in gear was gone, I'm missing rings, my sword and shield, and necklace!! This is not cool it seems to happening more often and if going to lose hard earned gear over it I might stop playing, please I really like this game, fix this issue!"", ""Order & chaos was a great game.. it reminds me of a game called EverQuest that I used to play... But like a lot of other people said in past reviews the hackers took the game over.. it's almost unplayable which is a shame because order & chaos is a great game...customer service isn't as bad as everybody says... But with no updates in the last 2 years it's like Gameloft just left us out in the cold.. if they can fix the hacking it would be 5 🌟"", ""If I could make it past the character creator I might have given this a better rating. Everytime I tried, it disconnected me from the network and I had to start all over again. I would totally give it a second try if the bugs were fixed but right now it's a no from me dawg"", 'Installation not working. It showed it was at 99% then reset back to 1%. It did this 2 times in a row. Install is broken. Last time i played four years ago there was nobody. Game is abandoned. Nobody in no lobby. Completely desserted. Not a single soul anywhere. Stopped updating the game more then a year ago. No more updates. Games never last forrever. It had a Godlike run 10yrs ago when it was in its prime and millions played. So dead its not even worth it.', ""In the very long time I've been away, (switched my phone and lost all progression of classes) the game change = very low population server/game, new character (4 lvl 70 players only) . The new revamp left alot to be desired. New areas to progress with relatively minimal exp gain from the majority of the new quests. With the low pop its hard to find a dungeon matchup so that would need some rework, ai char 2 cover missin players, possibly time to look into cross platforming of sorts, pc versions?"", ""I grew up with this game. Very sad that Gameloft abandoned it just as they always do with their games. Idk why GL makes the best mobile games and then just gives up and makes another one. Giving this 5 stars in the hopes people download it and they either start updating it again or sell it to a company that will give it the attention it deserves.

Very quickly you face opponents you cannot beat in free mode. Also actually receiving the daily perks is very hit or miss. This could easily be a 5 star game, but alas I will probably delete as I refuse to pay for basic game play and run out of things to do.', ""The game play, feel, and graphics thus far are excellent. I would rate 5 stars, but the pop up advertising is annoying, and detracts from the game experience. Perhaps an option to opt out of the ads. It's one thing to have an option to watch them to recharge energy, but it is annoying when they just show up in the middle of everything."", 'Good graphics. Love the landscape photos used for the background. Devs are friendly, fast to reply, and quickly resolve any issues. There is no lag whatsoever. Easy to learn, easy to play, difficult to win. Only issue is the same as Modern Warplanes, rewards decrease compared to equipment costs as you progress.', ""This game would have a 5 star if the two issues I've had we're attended to. Couldn't adjust the graphics at all, which was odd to me, at first I could. Then suddenly couldn't. Secondly, I can no longer collect gems from the echelon tournament. Which is something I heavily rely on for progress. Simply because I'm a collector, and have limited time to play. But, the dim side is they've clearly made a good game, but buggy as can be. The Devs don't support this game anymore, according to GameLoft."", ""Great game(5⭐), but after encountering a bug I can no longer play multiplayer. Support for this was complete nonsense as the best advice was to ensure that my phone was plugged into the ethernet cable... After asking multiple times for other suggestions and even clearing my cache, storage, reinstalling, and pulling my saved game from the sever; still no multiplayer. The game it self is total fun and we'll balanced but lack of support killed it for me."", ""Gameplay is ok. Simple and fun. However I played 5 matches and when I finally got gear to equip I couldn't do so. Because this game decided to put an AD right over the buttons needed to equip items and upgrade your character. I wouldn't even say it's a stupid design flaw. But more of a greedy decision to place it there. Uninstalling the app."", ""Honestly this game is amazing! I want to thank the developers for actually making a game that is overall enjoyable and playable! It's free, with the option for in game purchases, but they don't hound you to purchase things or make it to where eventually the game is so hard you need to just to advance. The graphics are amazing. Game play is amazing. Choosing between all the different armour/horses/lances/etc and the different looking leagues along with online play keep in interesting and fun!"", ""Nothing would please me more than to rate this game higher. Gameplay is excellent, and I truly, truly want to love it. But there's an issue with this game that I can't ignore: it refuses to hold your save data. I had to go through the tutorial multiple times giving it a chance. This is a simple but important issue, and I have no idea why it exists. May reinstall and give 5 stars if they fix this issue, but I highly doubt they will."", 'One would think that when we develop a unique app that uses controls to operate. We would give great opportunity for the players to practice as much as you want and at their own pace. I found this app to be interesting with great graphics, but to only to have a introduction of how to use the controls one time and only one time. I will not keep this app.', ""Bugs bugs bugs I can't play championship or friendship battles. I constantly lose because of missed targets when getting a perfect strike underneath the opponents armpit. This is the only target area that does this. I never get a missed target anywhere else. And accessing customer service is virtually impossible with the horrific web page design."", 'game is OK. its a bit shallow all the way around from the quality of game play to ability to customize, BUT it does show great potential. good looking game with a good feel. the variety of things to customize is there, but the graphics need refining. the jousting should really be from one perspective all the way through, not 2 different ones. having 2 dif ones takes away from realism and the challenge of focusing the lance thru the charge as the target finally closes to impact. 3 stars', 'Awesome game. One of the most original, realistic games I have played in a while not to mention this is a mobile app!!! Hats off to the developers on this one keep it up yall! Just as good as a console game. Refreshing to finally see games that have 3d gameplay it would be awesome if you could implement the graphics in real time real fighting war battles', 'This game is fun and enjoyable, especially so for one on the mobile market. The dialogue as you progress through the different leagues and interact with more characters leads to amusing encounters. You can unlock premium items through tournaments and events without paying money. I have two major complaints: The target missed glitch has occassionally cost me matches for no good reason. The game does crash randomly but these are usually infrequent.', ""Ads are too much to get over. I used to play this game on my iPhone got pretty far and then downloaded it on my new android. Unfortunately they've added ads in game which really irritates me. I deleted it. I am okay with clicking to watch ads to get free stuff like most games have, but not okay with a banner at the bottom."", ""Interesting take on the jousting genre. I'm actually enjoying it. Lol. Check it out if you have time to kill and can pay attention. The only drawback i have is it's joust, joust, joust. Over and over and over. The special side games are few and far between. If you could add another dimension to the game so the jousting doesn't get boring so quickly, that would increase playability."", 'Love the concept, wish single combat were an option at the end of the joust just to keep it more realistic. Kind of wish gems were easier to earn especially when they toss way higher ranked enemies at you quickly. Energy replenishes fairly quickly. Gold is fairly simple to earn. Just need to make some events for extra gems and it would be a solid 5* game. As stands it seems a little too pay to win friendly.', ""The network connection in the game is horrible. It cost me a great deal of currency which I was planning on using to upgrade my equipment. I was trying to play the echelon event, I had already registered the amount of currency needed but the game couldn't respond. It was after 5 mins when the event was over b4 it could regain connection again. It's frustrating."", 'Game could be incredible. I understand the devs have to make a living but plastering ads all over the place ruins this gorgeous and fun game. I would gladly have dropped 30 bucks to have a complete version without pay mechanics. Unfortunately another game getting uninstalled because of the way they choose to try to make money.', ""This game is very fun however I can't move to the new league despite clearing every stage in the old one. It seems a lot of people are having this issue and it's been around for some time. Pretty poor customer service in that regards as there should already have been a new update to fix that. If you take over a game make sure you keep an eye on it and fix it when it break."", ""Very Disappointed. Full of bugs and constant crashes. No response from developers even after losing hundreds of diamonds in the championship contests due to the constant crashes. I've lost so much gold too as it costs 1,500 coins to enter the championship. I've reached the league of the Dragon which is the final part of the game and now it's unplayable due to the above issues. As said, no response from developers after 20 odd complaints made. Don't waste your time. Total rubbish."", ""It was fun and great! But I only played it once, because I can't get into the game the second time. The loading screen takes 2 hours (or maybe more). My connection is stable and good just like when I played the game. Please fix this."", 'Fun game, nice graphics and animations. only downside is the cost for gem armour and the extremely slow way of earning it. The horse jumping mini game is quite tricky as the speed indicator dissappears and takes a second to reappear after the jumps meaning that you could miss a perfect run. Overall though it is a great timewaster 😎', ""Even though I started playing pretty late, this game is extremely addicting. Other than not being able to play in all 3 tournaments, except for the echelon I really can't complain but I would like to see a way to stack gold other than playing training missions over and over"", ""It's an enjoyable game though it is a little repeative. I think I made it up to the third or fourth league before the game suddenly stopped working for me. Considering that it hasn't been updated since April of 2021, I think I may have played my last joust. A pity since I would have liked to have seen how the story ends."", ""I can't get into tournaments or invite friends to play. I have social seals it won't let me use. I have a Samsung Galaxy but I don't see why that should affect playing this game. Newer phone. I enjoy playing the battles so I hope customer support sees this message and helps fix the issues before I uninstall it."", ""Great game, you have to wait a bit too long to regain royal seals however, it's overall solid and entretaining. I do have one problem with it though. It Won't let me play in the championships or the friend challenges and will only allow me to enter enchellon championships. Please fix this for me. And it will be a five star rating"", ""An awesome game in overall but if the developers add one or two options of generating coins rather than jus participating in training matches it would be very good. Secondly an option to know the stats of the opponent before entering the match so that we can quit if we want and don't have to lose it for no reason Thanks for developing such a game"", ""I played this game a few years ago and recently i returned to it. Unfortunately the game seems to have stopped receiving support from the devs. The last update on the game was in 2018 and the game at the moment is filled with tiny bugs that ruin your fun (certain bonuses paid with premium currency don't work, trying to add a friend as an ally is impossible and an entire side activity where you battle other people has become unavailable). It's such a shame because the game is so unique."", ""Overall it's a really good game the controls are fairly smooth and the graphics are decent but the in-app purchases are absurdly expensive because the only way you're going to get far in this game is to spend over $100 and that is ridiculousfor a mobile game. but other than the absurdly expensive in-app purchases the game is actually very fun. It is for sure worth it download."", ""On one hand, some of the best graphics I've seen in an Android game. On the other hand, lies about needing access to my contacts to use Google Play Games and asks every time I start the game when I won't give it. Seems to be highly P2W, despite constant ads."", ""I am in LOVE with this game. The horses gaits, strides, and movements are more realistic than most games with horses out there so there's an automatic five stars from me. Currency isn't too hard to get yet not too easy. Only giving it 4 stars because I have not made it too far into the game yet. Keep up the good work, I love it!"", ""I just downloaded this game,played for a while(liked it) , exit the game...now after a while I'm trying to enter again but it automatically exits from the loading screen. Tryed many times but still not letting me play."", ""I've been playing this game for a few years now. Since it came out actually and I love the game but these adds are starting to make me not like it as much. I don't mind that adds that play but the ones that sit at the bottom need to go or something. They block me from being able to click the buttons as they block them and I also can't see the time I have left in tournaments because of them. I also can't play multiplayer anymore what is up with that same as champions"", ""Just wish there was a better story line and more events. Like sword fighting or trying to win over the maiden. Good game but a total RIP off of knights tale the movie. My favorite movie you have so much more you could do with this game that is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. But why can't you fight in champion ship jousting. It is a fun and entertaining game and you don't have to blow money to win"", ""I rly love the game, but I have a problem with championship and frienlyes, i can't click on those two. But the game so far got me addicted. I love that they don't have so many adds and other annoying things, so I guess that this is the main reason that they don't get to mannage the bugs so quickly. Game is great guys. I love swiching gears on the horse🤣🤣🤣(csr2)"", 'Just recently opened the app, and i was forced to download an update, and now, the game is unplayable, it crashes and force closes at the title screen. Help?!', ""I remember when this game first came out in 2014, I played it a lot and the community was awesome. FF to today, only one PVP mode left and it's populated by bots. Not a single update in a long time. Awesome, fun game. Just slowly dying. Makes me sad UPDATE Game no longer even works"", 'Amazing Epic Game!!! The controls are smooth, graphics are really nice, art style is clean and vibrant! All sorts of upgrades available for you and your mount. Really fun and challenging as well. If you like the medieval era then you will get a real kick out of this app. Jump in, win some events grab some loot and come back tomorrow for more fun! Enjoy', ""The game is great, the only real problem that i have with it is the multiple times when i would've had a perfect hit, i would lose and the game would say that i missed the target. if this is fixed then the game would get 5 stars sense everything else is very good."", 'I really like the game and how its played but the multiplayer tournaments wont work anymore. I contacted customer service and that was a joke. You WILL have to spend money eventually, especially when you get in the last two levels of tournaments during the normal gameplay. Graphics are great and the game is fun.']",False,"['com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftGHHM', 'general.thankgames.com', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftGOHM', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftMMHM', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftO2HM']","['com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA9HM', 'com.gameloft.anmp.sniper.champions', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDMHM', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA8HM', 'com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDOHM']",com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftOKHM,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftOKHM&hl=en&gl=us
